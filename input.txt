In unanesthetized , spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous clonidine , 5 to 20 micrograms / kg , was inhibited or reversed

Effects of uninephrectomy and high protein feeding on lithium - induced chronic renal failure in rats .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Rats with lithium - induced nephropathy were subjected to high protein ( HP ) feeding , uninephrectomy ( NX ) or a combination of these , in an attempt to
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
induce glomerular hyperfiltration and further progression of renal failure .
O O O O O O O O O O
Newborn female Wistar rats were fed a lithium - containing diet ( 50 mmol / kg ) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet , HP diet (
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
40 vs . 19 % ) , NX or HP + NX for another 8 weeks .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Corresponding non - lithium pretreated groups were generated .
O O O B O O O O O
When comparing all lithium treated versus non - lithium - treated groups , lithium caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) without significant changes in effective renal
O O O B O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
plasma flow ( as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules ) or lithium clearance .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Consequently , lithium pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional Li excretion .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Lithium also caused proteinuria and systolic hypertension in absence of glomerulosclerosis .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
HP failed to accentuante progression of renal failure and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma creatinine levels in lithium pretreated rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O
NX caused an additive deterioration in GFR which , however , was ameliorated by HP .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
NX + HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in Li - pretreated rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The results indicate that Li - induced nephropathy , even when the GFR is only modestly reduced , is associated with proteinuria and arterial systolic hypertension .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this model of chronic renal failure the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow , which may be the functional expression
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli .

Treatment of Crohn 's disease with fusidic acid : an antibiotic with immunosuppressive properties similar to cyclosporin .
O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O B O
Fusidic acid is an antibiotic with T - cell specific immunosuppressive effects similar to those of cyclosporin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Because of the need for the development of new treatments for Crohn 's disease , a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of fusidic acid treatment
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
in chronic active , therapy - resistant patients .
O O O O O O O O O
Eight Crohn 's disease patients were included .
O O O O O O O O
Fusidic acid was administered orally in a dose of 500 mg t . d . s .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the treatment was planned to last 8 weeks .
O O O O O O O O O O
The disease activity was primarily measured by a modified individual grading score .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Five of 8 patients ( 63 % ) improved during fusidic acid treatment : 3 at two weeks and 2 after four weeks .
O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
There were no serious clinical side effects , but dose reduction was required in two patients because of nausea .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Biochemically , an increase in alkaline phosphatases was noted in 5 of 8 cases ( 63 % ) , and the greatest increases were seen in those who had elevated
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
levels prior to treatment .
O O O O O
All reversed to pre - treatment levels after cessation of treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results of this pilot study suggest that fusidic acid may be of benefit in selected chronic active Crohn 's disease patients in whom conventional treatment is ineffective .
O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because there seems to exist a scientific rationale for the use of fusidic acid at the cytokine level in inflammatory bowel disease , we suggest that the role of this
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
treatment should be further investigated .

Ocular and auditory toxicity in hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine .
O O O O O O O O B O
During an 18 - month period of study 41 hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine ( 10 - 40 mg / kg BW / 3 times weekly ) for the first time
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
were monitored for detection of audiovisual toxicity .
O O O O O O O O
6 patients presented clinical symptoms of visual or auditory toxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Moreover , detailed ophthalmologic and audiologic studies disclosed abnormalities in 7 more asymptomatic patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Visual toxicity was of retinal origin and was characterized by a tritan - type dyschromatopsy , sometimes associated with a loss of visual acuity and pigmentary retinal deposits .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Auditory toxicity was characterized by a mid - to high - frequency neurosensorial hearing loss and the lesion was of the cochlear type .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Desferrioxamine withdrawal resulted in a complete recovery of visual function in 1 patient and partial recovery in 3 , and a complete reversal of hearing loss in 3 patients and
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
partial recovery in 3 .
O O O O O
This toxicity appeared in patients receiving the higher doses of desferrioxamine or coincided with the normalization of ferritin or aluminium serum levels .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O
The data indicate that audiovisual toxicity is not an infrequent complication in hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Periodical audiovisual monitoring should be performed on hemodialyzed patients receiving the drug in order to detect adverse effects as early as possible .

Myasthenia gravis presenting as weakness after magnesium administration .
O O O O O O B O O
We studied a patient with no prior history of neuromuscular disease who became virtually quadriplegic after parenteral magnesium administration for preeclampsia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The serum magnesium concentration was 3 . 0 mEq / L , which is usually well tolerated .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The magnesium was stopped and she recovered over a few days .
O B O O O O O O O O O O
While she was weak , 2 - Hz repetitive stimulation revealed a decrement without significant facilitation at rapid rates or after exercise , suggesting postsynaptic neuromuscular blockade .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After her strength returned , repetitive stimulation was normal , but single fiber EMG revealed increased jitter and blocking .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Her acetylcholine receptor antibody level was markedly elevated .
O B O O O O O O O
Although paralysis after magnesium administration has been described in patients with known myasthenia gravis , it has not previously been reported to be the initial or only manifestation of the

Source of pain and primitive dysfunction in migraine : an identical site ?
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Twenty common migraine patients received a one sided frontotemporal application of nitroglycerin ( 10 patients ) or placebo ointment ( 10 patients ) in a double blind study .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Early onset migraine attacks were induced by nitroglycerin in seven out of 10 patients versus no patient in the placebo group .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Subsequently 20 migraine patients , who developed an early onset attack with frontotemporal nitroglycerin , received the drug in a second induction test at other body areas .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No early onset migraine was observed .
O O O O O O O
Thus the migraine - inducing effect of nitroglycerin seems to depend on direct stimulation of the habitual site of pain , suggesting that the frontotemporal region is of crucial importance
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the development of a migraine crisis .
O O O O O O O O
This is not consistent with a CNS origin of migraine attack .

Clotiazepam - induced acute hepatitis .

We report the case of a patient who developed acute hepatitis with extensive hepatocellular necrosis , 7 months after the onset of administration of clotiazepam , a thienodiazepine derivative .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O
Clotiazepam withdrawal was followed by prompt recovery .
B O O O O O O O
The administration of several benzodiazepines , chemically related to clotiazepam , did not interfere with recovery and did not induce any relapse of hepatitis .
O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This observation shows that clotiazepam can induce acute hepatitis and suggests that there is no cross hepatotoxicity between clotiazepam and several benzodiazepines .

Arterial hypertension as a complication of prolonged ketoconazole treatment .

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
In both cases normal plasma and urinary free cortisol levels had been achieved following ketoconazole therapy , yet continuous blood pressure monitoring demonstrated hypertension 31 ( patient 1 ) and
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
52 weeks ( patient 2 ) after treatment .
O O O O O O O O O
In patient 1 , plasma levels of deoxycorticosterone and 11 - deoxycortisol were elevated .
O O O O O O O B O B I I O O O
In patient 2 , in addition to an increase in both deoxycorticosterone and 11 - deoxycortisol levels , plasma aldosterone values were raised , with a concomitant suppression of renin
O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O O O B O O O O O O O O O O

Effects of an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme ( Captopril ) on pulmonary and renal insufficiency due to intravascular coagulation in the rat .
O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Induction of intravascular coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis by injection of thrombin and tranexamic acid ( AMCA ) in the rat gives rise to pulmonary and renal insufficiency resembling that
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
occurring after trauma or sepsis in man .
O O O O O O O O
Injection of Captopril ( 1 mg / kg ) , an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) , reduced both pulmonary and renal insufficiency in this rat model
O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
The lung weights were lower and PaO2 was improved in rats given this enzyme - blocking agent .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The contents of albumin in the lungs were not changed , indicating that Captopril did not influence the extravasation of protein .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Renal damage as reflected by an increase in serum urea and in kidney weight was prevented by Captopril .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O
The amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and AMCA alone .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
It is suggested that the effects of Captopril on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of Angiotension II and
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
an increase in prostacyclin ( secondary to an increase in bradykinin ) .
O O O B O O O O O O B O O
Captopril may , by the same mechanism , reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin , thereby diminishing the aggregation of
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
fibrin monomers in the glomeruli , with the result that less fibrin will be deposited and thus less kidney damage will be produced .

Chronic carbamazepine treatment in the rat : efficacy , toxicity , and effect on plasma and tissue folate concentrations .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Folate depletion has often been a problem in chronic antiepileptic drug ( AED ) therapy .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Carbamazepine ( CBZ ) , a commonly used AED , has been implicated in some clinical studies .
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A rat model was developed to examine the effects of chronic CBZ treatment on folate concentrations in the rat .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O
In the course of developing this model , a common vehicle , propylene glycol , by itself in high doses , was found to exhibit protective properties against induced seizures
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and inhibited weight gain .
O O O O O
Seizures induced by hexafluorodiethyl ether ( HFDE ) were also found to be a more sensitive measure of protection by CBZ than seizures induced by maximal electroshock ( MES )
O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Oral administration of CBZ as an aqueous suspension every 8 h at a dose of 250 mg / kg was continuously protective against HFDE - induced seizures and was minimally
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
toxic as measured by weight gain over 8 weeks of treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The CBZ levels measured in plasma and brain of these animals , however , were below those normally considered protective .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This treatment with CBZ had no apparent adverse effect on folate concentrations in the rat , and , indeed , the folate concentration increased in liver after 6 weeks of

treatment and in plasma at 8 weeks of treatment .

Multiple cytotoxic drug administration is the generally accepted treatment of patients with a high - risk stage of choriocarcinoma .

Based on this principle a 27 - year old woman , classified as being in the high - risk group ( Goldstein and Berkowitz score : 11 ) , was
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
treated with multiple cytotoxic drugs .
O O O O O O
The multiple drug schema consisted of : Etoposide 16 . 213 , Methotrexate , Cyclophosphamide , Actomycin - D , and Cisplatin .
O O O O O O O B O O O O B O B O B I I O O B O
On the first day of the schedule , moderate high doses of Methotrexate , Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide were administered .

Within 8 hours after initiation of therapy the patient died with a clinical picture resembling massive pulmonary obstruction due to choriocarcinomic tissue plugs , probably originating from the uterus .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive tumor necrosis at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins , which resulted in an open exchange of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
tumor plugs to the vascular spaces ; decrease in tumor tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of tumor emboli .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In view of the close time association between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive embolism other explanations , such as spontaneous necrosis , must be considered
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
less likely .

Patients with large pelvic tumor loads are , according to existing classifications , at high risk to die and to develop drug resistance .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Notwithstanding these facts our findings suggest that these patients might benefit from relatively mild initial treatment , especially true for patients not previously exposed to this drug .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Close observation of the response status both clinically and with beta - hCG values may indicate whether and when more agressive combination chemotherapy should be started . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

Sexual dysfunction among patients with arthritis .
O O O O O O O
The relationship of arthritis and sexual dysfunction was investigated among 169 patients with rheumatoid arthritis , osteoarthritis and spondyloarthropathy , 130 of whom were pair - matched to controls .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Assessments of marital happiness and depressed mood were also made using the CES - D and the Azrin Marital Happiness Scale ( AMHS ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sexual dysfunctions were found to be common among patients and controls , the majority in both groups reporting one or more dysfunctions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Impotence was more common among male patients than controls and was found to be associated with co - morbidity and the taking of methotrexate .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Depressed mood was more common among patients and was associated with certain sexual difficulties , but not with impotence .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Marital unhappiness , as indicated by AMHS scores , was not associated with arthritis but was associated with sexual dysfunction , sexual dissatisfaction and being female .

Does paracetamol cause urothelial cancer or renal papillary necrosis ?
O B O O O O O O O O
The risk of developing renal papillary necrosis or cancer of the renal pelvis , ureter or bladder associated with consumption of either phenacetin or paracetamol was calculated from data acquired
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
by questionnaire from 381 cases and 808 controls .
O O O O O O O O O
The risk of renal papillary necrosis was increased nearly 20 - fold by consumption of phenacetin , which also increased the risk for cancer of the renal pelvis and bladder
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but not for ureteric cancer .
O O O O O O
By contrast , we were unable to substantiate an increased risk from paracetamol consumption for renal papillary necrosis or any of these cancers although there was a suggestion of an
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
association with cancer of the ureter .

Dapsone - associated Heinz body hemolytic anemia in a Cambodian woman with hemoglobin E trait .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A Cambodian woman with hemoglobin E trait ( AE ) and leprosy developed a Heinz body hemolytic anemia while taking a dose of dapsone ( 50 mg / day )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
not usually associated with clinical hemolysis .
O O O O O O O
Her red blood cells ( RBCs ) had increased incubated Heinz body formation , decreased reduced glutathione ( GSH ) , and decreased GSH stability .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O B O O
The pentose phosphate shunt activity of the dapsone - exposed AE RBCs was increased compared to normal RBCs .
O B I O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Although the AE RBCs from an individual not taking dapsone had increased incubated Heinz body formation , the GSH content and GSH stability were normal .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O
The pentose phosphate shunt activity of the non - dapsone - exposed AE RBCs was decreased compared to normal RBCs .
O B I O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , AE RBCs appear to have an increased sensitivity to oxidant stress both in vitro and in vivo , since dapsone does not cause hemolytic anemia at this dose
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
in hematologically normal individuals .
O O O O O
Given the influx of Southeast Asians into the United States , oxidant medications should be used with caution , especially if an infection is present , in individuals of ethnic
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
backgrounds that have an increased prevalence of hemoglobin E .

Severe complications of antianginal drug therapy in a patient identified as a poor metabolizer of metoprolol , propafenone , diltiazem , and sparteine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O B O
A 47 - year - old patient suffering from coronary artery disease was admitted to the CCU in shock with III .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
AV block , severe hypotension , and impairment of ventricular function .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
One week prior to admission a therapy with standard doses of metoprolol ( 100 mg t . i . d .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
and then 100 mg b . i . d . ) had been initiated .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two days before admission diltiazem ( 60 mg b . i . d . ) was prescribed in addition .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Analyses of a blood sample revealed unusually high plasma concentrations of metoprolol ( greater than 3000 ng / ml ) and diltiazem ( 526 ng / ml ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The patient recovered within 1 week following discontinuation of antianginal therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Three months later the patient was exposed to a single dose of metoprolol , diltiazem , propafenone ( since he had received this drug in the past ) , and
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sparteine ( as a probe for the debrisoquine / sparteine type polymorphism of oxidative drug metabolism ) .
B O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O
It was found that he was a poor metabolizer of all four drugs , indicating that their metabolism is under the same genetic control .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , patients belonging to the poor - metabolizer phenotype of sparteine / debrisoquine polymorphism in drug metabolism , which constitutes 6 . 4 % of the German population ,
O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
may experience adverse drug reactions when treated with standard doses of one of these drugs alone .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Moreover , the coadministration of these frequently used drugs is expected to be especially harmful in this subgroup of patients .

On the mechanisms of the development of tolerance to the muscular rigidity produced by morphine in rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
The development of tolerance to the muscular rigidity produced by morphine was studied in rats .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Saline - pretreated controls given a test dose of morphine ( 20 mg / kg i . p . ) showed a pronounced rigidity recorded as tonic activity in the
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
electromyogram .
O O
Rats treated for 11 days with morphine and withdrawn for 36 - 40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance : about half of the animals showed a rigidity
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after the test dose of morphine that was not significantly less than in the controls and were akinetic ( A group ) .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The other rats showed a strong decrease in the rigidity and the occurrence of stereotyped ( S ) licking and / or gnawing in presence of akinetic or hyperkinetic (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
K ) behaviour ( AS / KS group ) , suggesting signs of dopaminergic activation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The rigidity was considerably decreased in both groups after 20 days ' treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In a further series of experiments , haloperidol ( 0 . 2 mg / kg i . p . ) was used in order to block the dopaminergic activation and
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to estimate the real degree of the tolerance to the rigidity without any dopaminergic interference .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Haloperidol enhanced the rigidity in the A group .
B O O O O O O O O
However , the level in the AS / KS group remained considerably lower than in the A group .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results suggest that rigidity , which is assumed to be due to an action of morphine in the striatum , can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
activation in the striatum .
O O O O O
Nevertheless , there occurs some real tolerance to this effect .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The rapid alternations of rigidity and the signs of dopaminergic activation observed in the animals of the AS / KS group might be due to rapid shifts in the predominance
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of various DA - innervated structures .

Compression neuropathy of the radial nerve due to pentazocine - induced fibrous myopathy .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Fibrous myopathy is a common , well - known side effect of repeated pentazocine injection .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
However , compression neuropathy due to fibrotic muscle affected by pentazocine - induced myopathy has not previously been reported .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
In a 37 - year - old woman with documented pentazocine - induced fibrous myopathy of triceps and deltoid muscles bilaterally and a three - week history of right wrist
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
drop , electrodiagnostic examination showed a severe but partial lesion of the right radial nerve distal to the branches to the triceps , in addition to the fibrous myopathy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Surgery revealed the right radial nerve to be severely compressed by the densely fibrotic lateral head of the triceps .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Decompression and neurolysis were performed with good subsequent recovery of function .

Recurrent reversible acute renal failure from amphotericin .
O O O O O O B O
A patient with cryptogenic cirrhosis and disseminated sporotrichosis developed acute renal failure immediately following the administration of amphotericin B on four separate occasions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
The abruptness of the renal failure and its reversibility within days suggests that there was a functional component to the renal dysfunction .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We propose that amphotericin , in the setting of reduced effective arterial volume , may activate tubuloglomerular feedback , thereby contributing to acute renal failure .

Pneumonitis with pleural and pericardial effusion and neuropathy during amiodarone therapy .
O O O O O O O O O B O O
A patient with sinuatrial disease and implanted pacemaker was treated with amiodarone ( maximum dose 1000 mg , maintenance dose 800 mg daily ) for 10 months , for control
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias .
O O O O
He developed pneumonitis , pleural and pericardial effusions , and a predominantly proximal motor neuropathy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Immediate but gradual improvement followed withdrawal of amiodarone and treatment with prednisolone .
O O O O O O O B O O O B O
Review of this and previously reported cases indicates the need for early diagnosis of amiodarone pneumonitis , immediate withdrawal of amiodarone , and prompt but continued steroid therapy to ensure
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O
full recovery .

Indomethacin - induced renal insufficiency : recurrence on rechallenge .
B O O O O O O O O O
We have reported a case of acute oliguric renal failure with hyperkalemia in a patient with cirrhosis , ascites , and cor pulmonale after indomethacin therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Prompt restoration of renal function followed drug withdrawal , while re - exposure to a single dose of indomethacin caused recurrence of acute reversible oliguria .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Our case supports the hypothesis that endogenous renal prostaglandins play a role in the maintenance of renal blood flow when circulating plasma volume is diminished .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Since nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory agents interfere with this compensatory mechanism and may cause acute renal failure , they should be used with caution in such patients .

Flunitrazepam 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 or 2 . 0 mg was given by the oral or i . m .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
routes to groups of volunteers and its effects compared .
O O O O O O O O O O
Plasma concentrations of the drug were estimated by gas - liquid chromatography , in a smaller number of the subjects .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The most striking effect was sedation which increased with the dose , 2 mg producing deep sleep although the subjects could still be aroused .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The effects of i . m .

Changes in heart size during long - term timolol treatment after myocardial infarction .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
The effect of long - term timolol treatment on heart size after myocardial infarction was evaluated by X - ray in a double - blind study including 241 patients (
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
placebo 126 , timolol 115 ) .
O O O B O O O
The follow - up period was 12 months .
O O O O O O O O O
The timolol - treated patients showed a small but significant increase in heart size from baseline in contrast to a decrease in the placebo group .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These differences may be caused by timolol - induced bradycardia and a compensatory increase in end - diastolic volume .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The timolol - related increase in heart size was observed only in patients with normal and borderline heart size .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In patients with cardiomegaly , the increase in heart size was similar in both groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After re - infarction , heart size increased in the placebo group and remained unchanged in the timolol group .

Vitamin D3 toxicity in dairy cows .
B I O O O O O
Large parenteral doses of vitamin D3 ( 15 to 17 . 5 x 10 ( 6 ) IU vitamin D3 ) were associated with prolonged hypercalcemia , hyperphosphatemia , and
O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
large increases of vitamin D3 and its metabolites in the blood plasma of nonlactating nonpregnant and pregnant Jersey cows .
O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Calcium concentrations 1 day postpartum were higher in cows treated with vitamin D3 about 32 days prepartum ( 8 . 8 mg / 100 ml ) than in control cows
B O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( 5 . 5 mg / 100 ml ) .
O O O O O O O O O O
None of the cows treated with vitamin D3 showed signs of milk fever during the peripartal period ; however , 22 % of the control cows developed clinical signs of
O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
milk fever during this period .
O O O O O O
Signs of vitamin D3 toxicity were not observed in nonlactating nonpregnant cows ; however , pregnant cows commonly developed severe signs of vitamin D3 toxicity and 10 of 17 cows
O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
died .
O O
There was widespread metastatic calcification in the cows that died .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Because of the extreme toxicity of vitamin D3 in pregnant Jersey cows and the low margin of safety between doses of vitamin D3 that prevent milk fever and doses that
O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
induce milk fever , we concluded that vitamin D3 can not be used practically to prevent milk fever when injected several weeks prepartum .

The anatomical and aetiological diagnoses of peripheral nerve disease excluding its primary benign and malignant disorders , as seen in 358 Nigerians are presented .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There is a male preponderance and the peak incidence is in the fourth decade .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sensori - motor neuropathy was the commonest presentation ( 50 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Guillain - Barr syndrome was the commonest identifiable cause ( 15 . 6 % ) , accounting for half of the cases with motor neuropathy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Peripheral neuropathy due to nutritional deficiency of thiamine and riboflavin was common ( 10 . 1 % ) and presented mainly as sensory and sensori - motor neuropathy .
O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Diabetes mellitus was the major cause of autonomic neuropathy .
O O O O O O O O O O
Isoniazid was the most frequent agent in drug - induced neuropathy .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
Migraine ( 20 % ) was not an uncommon cause of cranial neuropathy although malignancies arising from the reticuloendothelial system or related structures of the head and neck were more
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
frequent ( 26 % ) .
O O O O O O
In 26 . 5 % of all the cases , the aetiology of the neuropathy was undetermined .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Heredofamilial and connective tissue disorders were rare .

A double - blind study of the efficacy and safety of dothiepin hydrochloride in the treatment of major depressive disorder .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
In a 6 - week double - blind parallel treatment study , dothiepin and amitriptyline were compared to placebo in the treatment of 33 depressed outpatients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Dothiepin and amitriptyline were equally effective in alleviating the symptoms of depressive illness , and both were significantly superior to placebo .
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The overall incidence of side effects and the frequency and severity of blurred vision , dry mouth , and drowsiness were significantly less with dothiepin than with amitriptyline .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O
Dothiepin also produced fewer CNS and cardiovascular effects .
B O O O O O O O O
There were no clinically important changes in laboratory parameters .
O O O O O O O O O O
Dothiepin thus was found to be an effective antidepressant drug associated with fewer side effects than amitriptyline in the treatment of depressed outpatients .

Behavioral effects of diazepam and propranolol in patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O
The effects of oral doses of diazepam ( single dose of 10 mg and a median dose of 30 mg / day for 2 weeks ) and propranolol ( single
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
dose of 80 mg and a median dose of 240 mg / day for 2 weeks ) on psychological performance of patients with panic disorders and agoraphobia were investigated in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a double - blind , randomized and crossover design .
O O O O O O O O O O
Both drugs impaired immediate free recall but the decrease was greater for diazepam than propranolol .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
Delayed free recall was also impaired but the two drugs did not differ .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients tapped faster after propranolol than diazepam and they were more sedated after diazepam than propranolol .
O O O O B O B O O O O O O B O B O
After 2 weeks of treatment , patients tested 5 - 8 h after the last dose of medication did not show any decrement of performance .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results are similar to those previously found in healthy subjects .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Accumulation of drugs was not reflected in prolonged behavioral impairment .

Effect of aspirin on N - [ 4 - ( 5 - nitro - 2 - furyl ) - 2 - thiazolyl ] - formamide - induced epithelial proliferation in
O O B O B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O
the urinary bladder and forestomach of the rat .
O O O O O O O O O
The co - administration of aspirin with N - [ 4 - ( 5 - nitro - 2 - furyl ) - 2 - thiazolyl ] - formamide (
O O O O O B O B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I O
FANFT ) to rats resulted in a reduced incidence of FANFT - induced bladder carcinomas but a concomitant induction of forestomach tumors .
B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
An autoradiographic study was performed on male F - 344 rats fed diet containing FANFT at a level of 0 . 2 % and / or aspirin at a level
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
of 0 . 5 % to evaluate the effect of aspirin on the increased cell proliferation induced by FANFT in the forestomach and bladder .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
FANFT - induced cell proliferation in the bladder was significantly suppressed by aspirin co - administration after 4 weeks but not after 12 weeks .
B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the forestomach , and also in the liver , aspirin did not affect the FANFT - induced increase in labeling index .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O
The present results are consistent with the carcinogenicity experiment suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in FANFT carcinogenesis in the bladder and forestomach , and that aspirin 's effect on
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O
FANFT in the forestomach is not due to an irritant effect associated with increased cell proliferation .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also , there appears to be an adaptation by the rats to the chronic ingestion of aspirin .

Provocation of postural hypotension by nitroglycerin in diabetic autonomic neuropathy ?
O O O O O B O O O O O
The effect of nitroglycerin on heart rate and systolic blood pressure was compared in 5 normal subjects , 12 diabetic subjects without autonomic neuropathy , and 5 diabetic subjects with
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
autonomic neuropathy .
O O O
The magnitude and time course of the increase in heart rate and the decrease in systolic blood pressure after nitroglycerin were similar in the normal and diabetic subjects without autonomic
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
neuropathy , whereas a lesser increase in heart rate and a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure occurred in the diabetic subjects with autonomic neuropathy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is therefore suggested that caution should be exercised when prescribing vasodilator drugs in diabetic patients , particularly those with autonomic neuropathy .

Intracellular PRL content ranged from 1 . 9 to 9 . 4 times control levels , and PRL release in vitro was significantly and consistently higher than controls , after
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at least 8 days of DES exposure .
O O O O O B O O
Beyond 8 days of DES exposure , the immunochemically PRL - positive proportion of cells increased to over 50 % of the total population .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Increased density and / or size and PRL content were indicated for the majority of the PRL cell population in both types of separation protocols .

Metabolic involvement in adriamycin cardiotoxicity .
O O O B O O
The cardiotoxic effects of adriamycin were studied in mammalian myocardial cells in culture as a model system .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Adriamycin inhibited cell growth and the rhythmic contractions characteristic of myocardial cells in culture .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A possible involvement of energy metabolism was suggested previously , and in this study the adenylate energy charge and phosphorylcreatine mole fraction were determined in the adriamycin - treated cells
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O
.

Time course of lipid peroxidation in puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephropathy .
O O O O O O B I O O O O
Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ) - induced nephropathy , with antioxidants significantly reducing the proteinuria .
O B O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
The temporal relationship between lipid peroxidation in the kidney and proteinuria was examined in this study .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Rats were treated with a single IV injection of puromycin aminonucleoside , ( PAN , 7 . 5 mg / kg ) and 24 hour urine samples were obtained prior

Clomipramine - induced sleep disturbance does not impair its prolactin - releasing action .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The present study was undertaken to examine the role of sleep disturbance , induced by clomipramine administration , on the secretory rate of prolactin ( PRL ) in addition to
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the direct drug effect .
O O O O O
Two groups of supine subjects were studied under placebo - controlled conditions , one during the night , when sleeping ( n = 7 ) and the other at daytime
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, when awake ( n = 6 ) .
O O O O O O O O O
Each subject received a single 50 mg dose of clomipramine given orally 2 hours before blood collection .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Plasma PRL concentrations were analysed at 10 min intervals and underlying secretory rates calculated by a deconvolution procedure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For both experiments the drug intake led to significant increases in PRL secretion , acting preferentially on tonic secretion as pulse amplitude and frequency did not differ significantly from corresponding
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
control values .
O O O
During the night clomipramine ingestion altered the complete sleep architecture in that it suppressed REM sleep and the sleep cycles and induced increased wakefulness .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As the relative increase in PRL secretion expressed as a percentage of the mean did not significantly differ between the night and day time studies ( 46 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The presence of REM sleep was shown not to be a determining factor either for secretory pulse amplitude and frequency , as , for both , mean nocturnal values were

similar with and without prior clomipramine ingestion .

Effect of coniine on the developing chick embryo .
O O B O O O O O O
Coniine , an alkaloid from Conium maculatum ( poison hemlock ) , has been shown to be teratogenic in livestock .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The major teratogenic outcome is arthrogryposis , presumably due to nicotinic receptor blockade .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , coniine has failed to produce arthrogryposis in rats or mice and is only weakly teratogenic in rabbits .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of coniine and nicotine in the developing chick .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
Concentrations of coniine and nicotine sulfate were 0 . 015 % , 0 . 03 % , 0 . 075 % , 0 . 15 % , 0 . 75
O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
% , 1 . 5 % , 3 % , and 6 % and 1 % , 5 % , and 10 % , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both compounds caused deformations and lethality in a dose - dependent manner .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All concentrations of nicotine sulfate caused some lethality but a no effect level for coniine lethality was 0 . 75 % .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The deformations caused by both coniine and nicotine sulfate were excessive flexion or extension of one or more toes .
O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
No histopathological alterations or differences in bone formation were seen in the limbs or toes of any chicks from any group ; however , extensive cranial hemorrhage occurred in all
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nicotine sulfate - treated chicks .
B O O O O O
There was a statistically significant ( P < or = 0 . 01 ) decrease in movement in coniine and nicotine sulfate treated chicks as determined by ultrasound .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O
Control chicks were in motion an average of 33 . 67 % of the time , while coniine - treated chicks were only moving 8 . 95 % of a
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 - min interval , and no movement was observed for nicotine sulfate treated chicks .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
In summary , the chick embryo provides a reliable and simple experimental animal model of coniine - induced arthrogryposis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Data from this model support a mechanism involving nicotinic receptor blockade with subsequent decreased fetal movement .

O O O O B I O B O O O
To evaluate the effect of prostaglandin E1 ( PGE1 ) or trimethaphan ( TMP ) induced hypotension on epidural blood flow ( EBF ) during spinal surgery , EBF was
O O O O O B I O B O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
measured using the heat clearance method in 30 patients who underwent postero - lateral interbody fusion under isoflurane anaesthesia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
An initial dose of 0 . 1 microgram . kg - 1 . min - 1 of PGE1 ( 15 patients ) , or 10 micrograms . kg - 1
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
. min - 1 of TMP ( 15 patients ) was administered intravenously after the dural opening and the dose was adjusted to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure (
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
MAP ) at about 60 mmHg .
O O O O O O O
The hypotensive drug was discontinued at the completion of the operative procedure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After starting PGE1 or TMP , MAP and rate pressure product ( RPP ) decreased significantly compared with preinfusion values ( P < 0 . 01 ) , and the
O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
degree of hypotension due to PGE1 remained constant until 60 min after its discontinuation .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Heart rate ( HR ) did not change in either group .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
EBFF did not change during PGE1 infusion whereas in the TMP group , EBF decreased significantly at 30 and 60 min after the start of TMP ( preinfusion : 45

Through 30 years of widespread use , acetaminophen has been shown to be a remarkably safe medication in therapeutic dosages .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The potential for acetaminophen to produce cardiovascular toxicities is very low .

Adverse effects of antipsychotics often lead to noncompliance .
O O O O O O O O O
Thus , clinicians should address patients ' concerns about adverse effects and attempt to choose medications that will improve their patients ' quality of life as well as overall health
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
The side effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics are more advantageous than those of the conventional neuroleptics .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Conventional agents are associated with unwanted central nervous system effects , including extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ) , tardive dyskinesia , sedation , and possible impairment of some cognitive measures
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, as well as cardiac effects , orthostatic hypotension , hepatic changes , anticholinergic side effects , sexual dysfunction , and weight gain .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The newer atypical agents have a lower risk of EPS , but are associated in varying degrees with sedation , cardiovascular effects , anticholinergic effects , weight gain , sexual
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dysfunction , hepatic effects , lowered seizure threshold ( primarily clozapine ) , and agranulocytosis ( clozapine only ) .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O
Since the incidence and severity of specific adverse effects differ among the various atypicals , the clinician should carefully consider which side effects are most likely to lead to the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
individual 's dissatisfaction and noncompliance before choosing an antipsychotic for a particular patient .

Tetrandrine ( TET ) and fangchinoline ( FAN ) are two naturally occurring analogues with a bisbenzylisoquinoline structure .
B O B O O B O B O O O O O O O O B O O
The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of TET and FAN on the experimental thrombosis induced by collagen plus epinephrine ( EP ) in mice , and platelet

aggregation and blood coagulation in vitro .
O O O O O O O
In the in vivo study , the administration ( 50 mg / kg , i . p . )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of TET and FAN in mice showed the inhibition of thrombosis by 55 % and 35 % , respectively , while acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA , 50 mg / kg

In the vitro human platelet aggregations induced by the agonists used in tests , TET and FAN showed the inhibitions dose dependently .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O
In addition , neither TET nor FAN showed any anticoagulation activities in the measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) , prothrombin time ( PT ) and

BACKGROUND :
O O
Although the prevalence of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) is high among elderly patients , few data are available regarding the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy in this

group of patients .
O O O O
Recent reports indicate that single agent therapy with vinorelbine ( VNB ) or gemcitabine ( GEM ) may obtain a response rate of 20 - 30 % in elderly patients
O O O O O O O O B O B O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, with acceptable toxicity and improvement in symptoms and quality of life .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the current study the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of GEM and VNB in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC or those with some contraindication to receiving cisplatin were

CONCLUSIONS :
O O
The combination of GEM and VNB is moderately active and well tolerated except in patients age > / = 75 years .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This age group had an increased risk of myelosuppression .
O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore the prophylactic use of granulocyte - colony stimulating factor should be considered with this treatment .

New chemotherapy combinations with higher activity and lower toxicity are needed for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC .

Warfarin - induced artery calcification is accelerated by growth and vitamin D .
B O O O O O O O O O B I O
The present studies demonstrate that growth and vitamin D treatment enhance the extent of artery calcification in rats given sufficient doses of Warfarin to inhibit gamma - carboxylation of matrix
O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Gla protein , a calcification inhibitor known to be expressed by smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the artery wall .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery calcification in Warfarin - treated rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Treatment for 2 weeks with Warfarin caused massive focal calcification of the artery media in 20 - day - old rats and less extensive focal calcification in 42 - day
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- old rats .
O O O O
In contrast , no artery calcification could be detected in 10 - month - old adult rats even after 4 weeks of Warfarin treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
To directly examine the importance of growth to Warfarin - induced artery calcification in animals of the same age , 20 - day - old rats were fed for 2
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6 - g / d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with Warfarin produced massive focal calcification of the artery media in the ad libitum - fed rats but no detectable artery calcification in the
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
restricted - diet , growth - inhibited group .
O O O O O O O O O
Although the explanation for the association between artery calcification and growth status can not be determined from the present study , there was a relationship between higher serum phosphate and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
susceptibility to artery calcification , with 30 % higher levels of serum phosphate in young , ad libitum - fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to Warfarin - induced artery calcification , ie , the 10 - month - old rats and the restricted - diet , growth - inhibited young rats .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to Warfarin - induced artery calcification could be related to higher serum phosphate levels .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O
The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between vitamin D and Warfarin in artery calcification .
O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O
High doses of vitamin D are known to cause calcification of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 days .
O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
High doses of the vitamin K antagonist Warfarin are also known to cause calcification of the artery media , but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not
O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at 1 week .
O O O O
In the current study , we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent Warfarin administration dramatically increased the extent of calcification in the media of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
vitamin D - treated rats at 3 and 4 days .
B I O O O O O O O O O
There was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin D dose on artery calcification and the effect of vitamin D dose on the elevation of serum calcium , which
O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O B O O
suggests that vitamin D may induce artery calcification through its effect on serum calcium .
O O B I O O O O O O O O O B O
Because Warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin D , the synergy between Warfarin and vitamin D is probably best explained by the
O B O O O O O O O O O B O O B I O O O O B O B I O O O O O O
hypothesis that Warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a calcification inhibitor .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin D plus Warfarin , and chemical analysis showed that the protein that
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O
accumulated was indeed not gamma - carboxylated .
O O O O B I I O
These observations indicate that although the gamma - carboxyglutamate residues of matrix Gla protein are apparently required for its function as a calcification inhibitor , they are not required for
O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its accumulation at calcification sites .

Antidepressant - induced mania in bipolar patients : identification of risk factors .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND : Concerns about possible risks of switching to mania associated with antidepressants continue to interfere with the establishment of an optimal treatment paradigm for bipolar depression .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHOD :
O O
The response of 44 patients meeting DSM - IV criteria for bipolar disorder to naturalistic treatment was assessed for at least 6 weeks using the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Scale and the Bech - Rafaelson Mania Rating Scale .
O O O O O O O O O O
Patients who experienced a manic or hypomanic switch were compared with those who did not on several variables including age , sex , diagnosis ( DSM - IV bipolar I
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
vs . bipolar II ) , number of previous manic episodes , type of antidepressant therapy used ( electroconvulsive therapy vs . antidepressant drugs and , more particularly , selective
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
serotonin reuptake inhibitors [ SSRIs ] ) , use and type of mood stabilizers ( lithium vs . anticonvulsants ) , and temperament of the patient , assessed during a
B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
normothymic period using the hyperthymia component of the Semi - structured Affective Temperament Interview .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Switches to hypomania or mania occurred in 27 % of all patients ( N = 12 ) ( and in 24 % of the subgroup of patients treated with
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
SSRIs [ 8 / 33 ] ) ; 16 % ( N = 7 ) experienced manic episodes , and 11 % ( N = 5 ) experienced hypomanic episodes
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Sex , age , diagnosis ( bipolar I vs . bipolar II ) , and additional treatment did not affect the risk of switching .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The incidence of mood switches seemed not to differ between patients receiving an anticonvulsant and those receiving no mood stabilizer .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , mood switches were less frequent in patients receiving lithium ( 15 % , 4 / 26 ) than in patients not treated with lithium ( 44 %
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
, 8 / 18 ; p = . 04 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The number of previous manic episodes did not affect the probability of switching , whereas a high score on the hyperthymia component of the Semistructured Affective Temperament Interview was associated
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with a greater risk of switching ( p = . 008 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
The frequency of mood switching associated with acute antidepressant therapy may be reduced by lithium treatment .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O
Particular attention should be paid to patients with a hyperthymic temperament , who have a greater risk of mood switches .

Combined antiretroviral therapy causes cardiomyopathy and elevates plasma lactate in transgenic AIDS mice .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) is implicated in cardiomyopathy ( CM ) and in elevated plasma lactate ( LA ) in AIDS through mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O
To determine mitochondrial events from HAART in vivo , 8 - week - old hemizygous transgenic AIDS mice ( NL4 - 3Delta gag / pol ; TG ) and wild
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

After 35 days in the TG + HAART cohort , left ventricular mass increased 160 % by echocardiography .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Molecularly , ANF mRNA increased 250 % and SERCA2 mRNA decreased 57 % .

Oral contraceptives and the risk of myocardial infarction .
B I O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
An association between the use of oral contraceptives and the risk of myocardial infarction has been found in some , but not all , studies .
O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We investigated this association , according to the type of progestagen included in third - generation ( i . e . , desogestrel or gestodene ) and second - generation
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
( i . e . , levonorgestrel ) oral contraceptives , the dose of estrogen , and the presence or absence of prothrombotic mutations METHODS :
O O O O O O B O B I O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
In a nationwide , population - based , case - control study , we identified and enrolled 248 women 18 through 49 years of age who had had a first
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
myocardial infarction between 1990 and 1995 and 925 control women who had not had a myocardial infarction and who were matched for age , calendar year of the index event
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, and area of residence .

Subjects supplied information on oral - contraceptive use and major cardiovascular risk factors .
O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
An analysis for factor V Leiden and the G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene was conducted in 217 patients and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
763 controls RESULTS :
O O O O
The odds ratio for myocardial infarction among women who used any type of combined oral contraceptive , as compared with nonusers , was 2 . 0 ( 95 percent confidence
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
interval , 1 . 5 to 2 . 8 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The adjusted odds ratio was 2 . 5 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1 . 5 to 4 . 1 ) among women who used second - generation
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oral contraceptives and 1 . 3 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 7 to 2 . 5 ) among those who used third - generation oral contraceptives .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Among women who used oral contraceptives , the odds ratio was 2 . 1 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1 . 5 to 3 . 0 ) for those
O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
without a prothrombotic mutation and 1 . 9 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 6 to 5 . 5 ) for those with a mutation CONCLUSIONS : The
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
risk of myocardial infarction was increased among women who used second - generation oral contraceptives .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
The results with respect to the use of third - generation oral contraceptives were inconclusive but suggested that the risk was lower than the risk associated with second - generation
O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oral contraceptives .
B I O
The risk of myocardial infarction was similar among women who used oral contraceptives whether or not they had a prothrombotic mutation .

Effects of 5 - HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbal shell or core on the cocaine - induced locomotor hyperactivity in rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The present study was designed to examine the effect of 5 - HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the subregions of the nucleus accumbens ( the shell and the core )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on the locomotor hyperactivity induced by cocaine in rats .
O O O O O O B O O O
Male Wistar rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae into the accumbens shell or core , and then were locally injected with GR 55562 ( an antagonist of 5 - HT1B
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
receptors ) or CP 93129 ( an agonist of 5 - HT1B receptors ) .
O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
Given alone to any accumbal subregion , GR 55562 ( 0 . 1 - 10 microg / side ) or CP 93129 ( 0 . 1 - 10 microg /
O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
side ) did not change basal locomotor activity .
O O O O O O O O O
Systemic cocaine ( 10 mg / kg ) significantly increased the locomotor activity of rats .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
GR 55562 ( 0 . 1 - 10 microg / side )
B I O O O O O O O O O O
, administered intra - accumbens shell prior to cocaine , dose - dependently attenuated the psychostimulant - induced locomotor hyperactivity .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Such attenuation was not found in animals which had been injected with GR 55562 into the accumbens core .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
When injected into the accumbens shell ( but not the core ) before cocaine , CP 93129 ( 0 . 1 - 10 microg / side ) enhanced the locomotor
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
response to cocaine ; the maximum effect being observed after 10 microg / side of the agonist .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The later enhancement was attenuated after intra - accumbens shell treatment with GR 55562 ( 1 microg / side ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
Our findings indicate that cocaine induced hyperlocomotion is modified by 5 - HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbens shell , but not core , this modification consisting in inhibitory
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and facilitatory effects of the 5 - HT1B receptor antagonist ( GR 55562 ) and agonist ( CP 93129 ) , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O B I O O O O
In other words , the present results suggest that the accumbal shell 5 - HT1B receptors play a permissive role in the behavioural response to the psychostimulant .

Ticlopidine - induced cholestatic hepatitis .
B O O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To report 2 cases of ticlopidine - induced cholestatic hepatitis , investigate its mechanism , and compare the observed main characteristics with those of the published cases .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CASE SUMMARIES :
O O O
Two patients developed prolonged cholestatic hepatitis after receiving ticlopidine following percutaneous coronary angioplasty , with complete remission during the follow - up period .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
T - cell stimulation by therapeutic concentration of ticlopidine was demonstrated in vitro in the patients , but not in healthy controls .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DISCUSSION :
O O
Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare complication of the antiplatelet agent ticlopidine ; several cases have been reported but few in the English literature .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our patients developed jaundice following treatment with ticlopidine and showed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of cholestatic hepatitis , which resolved after discontinuation of the drug .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hepatitis may develop weeks after discontinuation of the drug and may run a prolonged course , but complete remission was observed in all reported cases .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug event was probably related to the use of ticlopidine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The mechanisms of this ticlopidine - induced cholestasis are unclear .
O O O O B O O O O O O
Immune mechanisms may be involved in the drug 's hepatotoxicity , as suggested by the T - cell stimulation study reported here .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare adverse effect of ticlopidine that may be immune mediated .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Patients receiving the drug should be monitored with liver function tests along with complete blood cell counts .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This complication will be observed even less often in the future as ticlopidine is being replaced by the newer antiplatelet agent clopidogrel .

Epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC ) subunit mRNA and protein expression in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrotic syndrome .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
In experimental nephrotic syndrome , urinary sodium excretion is decreased during the early phase of the disease .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
The molecular mechanism ( s ) leading to salt retention has not been completely elucidated .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The rate - limiting constituent of collecting duct sodium transport is the epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC ) .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O
We examined the abundance of ENaC subunit mRNAs and proteins in puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ) - induced nephrotic syndrome .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O
The time courses of urinary sodium excretion , plasma aldosterone concentration and proteinuria were studied in male Sprague - Dawley rats treated with a single dose of either PAN or
O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
vehicle .
O O
The relative amounts of alphaENaC , betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNAs were determined in kidneys from these rats by real - time quantitative TaqMan PCR , and the amounts of proteins
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by Western blot .
O O O O
The kinetics of urinary sodium excretion and the appearance of proteinuria were comparable with those reported previously .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sodium retention occurred on days 2 , 3 and 6 after PAN injection .
B O O O O O O O O O O B O O
A significant up - regulation of alphaENaC and betaENaC mRNA abundance on days 1 and 2 preceded sodium retention on days 2 and 3 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Conversely , down - regulation of alphaENaC , betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNA expression on day 3 occurred in the presence of high aldosterone concentrations , and was followed by a
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
return of sodium excretion to control values .
O O B O O O O O
The amounts of alphaENaC , betaENaC and gammaENaC proteins were not increased during PAN - induced sodium retention .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O
In conclusion , ENaC mRNA expression , especially alphaENaC , is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of PAN - induced nephrotic syndrome in rats ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
but appears to escape from the regulation by aldosterone after day 3 .

NO - induced migraine attack : strong increase in plasma calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) concentration and negative correlation with platelet serotonin release .
B O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B O O O O O O O B O O
The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the plasma calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) concentration and platelet serotonin ( 5 - hydroxytriptamine ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B O O O O B O B I I O
5 - HT ) content during the immediate headache and the delayed genuine migraine attack provoked by nitroglycerin .
B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Fifteen female migraineurs ( without aura ) and eight controls participated in the study .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sublingual nitroglycerin ( 0 . 5 mg ) was administered .
O B O O O O O O O O O
Blood was collected from the antecubital vein four times : 60 min before and after the nitroglycerin application , and 60 and 120 min after the beginning of the migraine
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
attack ( mean 344 and 404 min ; 12 subjects ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
In those subjects who had no migraine attack ( 11 subjects ) a similar time schedule was used .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Plasma CGRP concentration increased significantly ( P < 0 . 01 ) during the migraine attack and returned to baseline after the cessation of the migraine .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , both change and peak , showed significant positive correlations with migraine headache intensity ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , plasma CGRP concentrations failed to change during immediate headache and in the subjects with no migraine attack .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Basal CGRP concentration was significantly higher and platelet 5 - HT content tended to be lower in subjects who experienced a migraine attack .
O B O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Platelet serotonin content decreased significantly ( P < 0 . 01 ) after nitroglycerin in subjects with no migraine attack but no consistent change was observed in patients with migraine
O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
attack .
O O
In conclusion , the fact that plasma CGRP concentration correlates with the timing and severity of a migraine headache suggests a direct relationship between CGRP and migraine .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
In contrast , serotonin release from platelets does not provoke migraine , it may even counteract the headache and the concomitant CGRP release in this model .

vessel wall with incomplete stent apposition , aneurysm formation and with the potential of stent thrombosis or vessel rupture .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We present a 43 - year - old man who developed a coronary aneurysm in the right coronary artery 6 months after receiving a paclitaxel - eluting stent .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The patient was asymptomatic and the aneurysm was detected in a routine control .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Angiography and intracoronary ultrasound demonstrated lack of contact between stent and vessel wall in a 15 - mm long segment with maximal aneurysm diameter of 6 . 0 mm .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient was successfully treated with a graft stent .

Behavioral effects of urotensin - II centrally administered in mice .
O O O B I I O O O O O
Urotensin - II ( U - II ) receptors are widely distributed in the central nervous system .
B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
Intracerebroventricular ( i . c . v . ) injection of U - II causes hypertension and bradycardia and stimulates prolactin and thyrotropin secretion .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
However , the behavioral effects of centrally administered U - II have received little attention .
O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O
In the present study , we tested the effects of i . c . v .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
injections of U - II on behavioral , metabolic , and endocrine responses in mice .
O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
Administration of graded doses of U - II ( 1 - 10 , 000 ng / mouse ) provoked : ( 1 ) a dose - dependent reduction in the
O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
number of head dips in the hole - board test ; ( 2 ) a dose - dependent reduction in the number of entries in the white chamber in the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
black - and - white compartment test , and in the number of entries in the central platform and open arms in the plus - maze test ; and (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 ) a dose - dependent increase in the duration of immobility in the forced - swimming test and tail suspension test .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Intracerebroventricular injection of U - II also caused an increase in : food intake at doses of 100 and 1 , 000 ng / mouse , water intake at doses
O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of 100 - 10 , 000 ng / mouse , and horizontal locomotion activity at a dose of 10 , 000 ng / mouse .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Whatever was the dose , the central administration of U - II had no effect on body temperature , nociception , apomorphine - induced penile erection and climbing behavior ,
O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
and stress - induced plasma corticosterone level .
O O O O O B O O
Taken together , the present study demonstrates that the central injection of U - II at doses of 1 - 10 , 000 ng / mouse induces anxiogenic - and
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
depressant - like effects in mouse .
O O O O O O O
These data suggest that U - II may be involved in some aspects of psychiatric disorders .

Recurrent dysphonia and acitretin .
O O O B O
We report the case of a woman complaining of dysphonia while she was treated by acitretin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Her symptoms totally regressed after drug withdrawal and reappeared when acitretin was reintroduced .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
To our knowledge , this is the first case of acitretin - induced dysphonia .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
This effect may be related to the pharmacological effect of this drug on mucous membranes .

Pharmacological modulation of pain - related brain activity during normal and central sensitization states in humans .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Abnormal processing of somatosensory inputs in the central nervous system ( central sensitization ) is the mechanism accounting for the enhanced pain sensitivity in the skin surrounding tissue injury (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
secondary hyperalgesia ) .
O O O O
Secondary hyperalgesia shares clinical characteristics with neurogenic hyperalgesia in patients with neuropathic pain .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Abnormal brain responses to somatosensory stimuli have been found in patients with hyperalgesia as well as in normal subjects during experimental central sensitization .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The aim of this study was to assess the effects of gabapentin , a drug effective in neuropathic pain patients , on brain processing of nociceptive information in normal and
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
central sensitization states .
O O O O
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) in normal volunteers , we studied the gabapentin - induced modulation of brain activity in response to nociceptive mechanical stimulation of normal
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
skin and capsaicin - induced secondary hyperalgesia .
O O B O O O O O
The dose of gabapentin was 1 , 800 mg per os , in a single administration .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We found that ( i ) gabapentin reduced the activations in the bilateral operculoinsular cortex , independently of the presence of central sensitization ; ( ii ) gabapentin reduced the
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
activation in the brainstem , only during central sensitization ; ( iii ) gabapentin suppressed stimulus - induced deactivations , only during central sensitization ; this effect was more robust
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
than the effect on brain activation .
O O O O O O O
The observed drug - induced effects were not due to changes in the baseline fMRI signal .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings indicate that gabapentin has a measurable antinociceptive effect and a stronger antihyperalgesic effect most evident in the brain areas undergoing deactivation , thus supporting the concept that
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
gabapentin is more effective in modulating nociceptive transmission when central sensitization is present .

MDMA polydrug users show process - specific central executive impairments coupled with impaired social and emotional judgement processes .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In recent years working memory deficits have been reported in users of MDMA ( 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine , ecstasy ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I I I O B O O
The current study aimed to assess the impact of MDMA use on three separate central executive processes ( set shifting , inhibition and memory updating ) and also on """"
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
prefrontal """" mediated social and emotional judgement processes .
O O O O O O O O O
Fifteen polydrug ecstasy users and 15 polydrug non - ecstasy user controls completed a general drug use questionnaire , the Brixton Spatial Anticipation task ( set shifting ) , Backward
O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Digit Span procedure ( memory updating ) , Inhibition of Return ( inhibition ) , an emotional intelligence scale , the Tromso Social Intelligence Scale and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DEX ) .
O O O
Compared with MDMA - free polydrug controls , MDMA polydrug users showed impairments in set shifting and memory updating , and also in social and emotional judgement processes .
O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The latter two deficits remained significant after controlling for other drug use .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These data lend further support to the proposal that cognitive processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex may be impaired by recreational ecstasy use .

Severe citrate toxicity complicating volunteer apheresis platelet donation .
O B O O O O O O O
We report a case of severe citrate toxicity during volunteer donor apheresis platelet collection .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
The donor was a 40 - year - old female , first - time apheresis platelet donor .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Past medical history was remarkable for hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and depression .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Reported medications included bumetanide , pravastatin , and paroxetine .
O O O B O B O O B O
Thirty minutes from the start of the procedure , the donor noted tingling around the mouth , hands , and feet .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She then very rapidly developed acute onset of severe facial and extremity tetany .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Empirical treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate was initiated , and muscle contractions slowly subsided over approximately 10 to 15 minutes .
O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The events are consistent with a severe reaction to calcium chelation by sodium citrate anticoagulant resulting in symptomatic systemic hypocalcemia .
O O O O O O O O O B O O B I O O O O O O O
Upon additional retrospective analysis , it was noted that bumetanide is a loop diuretic that may cause significant hypocalcemia .
O O O O O O O O O B O O B I O O O O O O
We conclude that careful screening for medications and underlying conditions predisposing to hypocalcemia is recommended to help prevent severe reactions due to citrate toxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Laboratory measurement of pre - procedure serum calcium levels in selected donors may identify cases requiring heightened vigilance .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
The case also illustrates the importance of maintaining preparedness for managing rare but serious reactions in volunteer apheresis blood donors .

Proteinuria after conversion to sirolimus in renal transplant recipients .
O O O O B O O O O O
Sirolimus ( SRL ) is a new , potent immunosuppressive agent .
B O B O O O O O O O O O
More recently , proteinuria has been reported as a consequence of sirolimus therapy , although the mechanism has remained unclear .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
We retrospectively examined the records of 25 renal transplant patients , who developed or displayed increased proteinuria after SRL conversion .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
The patient cohort ( 14 men , 11 women ) was treated with SRL as conversion therapy , due to chronic allograft nephropathy ( CAN ) ( n = 15
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) neoplasia ( n = 8 ) ; Kaposi 's sarcoma , Four skin cancers , One intestinal tumors , One renal cell carsinom ) or BK virus nephropathy (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
n = 2 ) .
O O O O O
SRL was started at a mean of 78 + / -
B O O O O O O O O O O
42 ( 15 to 163 ) months after transplantation .
O O O O O O O O O O
Mean follow - up on SRL therapy was 20 + / -
O O O O O B O O O O O O
12 ( 6 to 43 ) months .
O O O O O O O O
Proteinuria increased from 0 . 445 ( 0 to 1 . 5 ) g / d before conversion to 3 . 2 g / dL ( 0 . 2 to
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
12 ) after conversion ( P = 0 . 001 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Before conversion 8 ( 32 % ) patients had no proteinuria , whereas afterwards all patients had proteinuria .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 28 % of patients proteinuria remained unchanged , whereas it increased in 68 % of patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 40 % it increased by more than 100 % .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Twenty - eight percent of patients showed increased proteinuria to the nephrotic range .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Biopsies performed in five patients revealed new pathological changes : One membranoproliferative glomerulopathy and interstitial nephritis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These patients showed persistently good graft function .
O O O O O O O O
Serum creatinine values did not change significantly : 1 . 98 + / -
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
0 . 8 mg / dL before SRL therapy and 2 . 53 + / -
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
1 . 9 mg / dL at last follow - up
O O O O O O O O O O O
( P = . 14 ) .
O O O O O O O
Five grafts were lost and the patients returned to dialysis .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Five patients displayed CAN and Kaposi 's sarcoma .
O O O O O O O O O
Mean urinary protein of patients who returned to dialysis was 1 . 26 ( 0 . 5 to 3 . 5 )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
g
O
/ d before and 4 . 7 ( 3 to 12 ) g / d after conversion ( P = . 01 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mean serum creatinine level before conversion was 2 . 21 mg / dL and thereafter , 4 . 93 mg / dL ( P = . 02 ) .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Heavy proteinuria was common after the use of SRL as rescue therapy for renal transplantation .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Therefore , conversion should be considered for patients who have not developed advanced CAN and proteinuria .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The possibility of de novo glomerular pathology under SRL treatment requires further investigation by renal biopsy .

In vitro characterization of parasympathetic and sympathetic responses in cyclophosphamide - induced cystitis in the rat .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
In cyclophosphamide - induced cystitis in the rat , detrusor function is impaired and the expression and effects of muscarinic receptors altered .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Whether or not the neuronal transmission may be affected by cystitis was presently investigated .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Responses of urinary strip preparations from control and cyclophosphamide - pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and to agonists were assessed in the absence and presence of muscarinic , adrenergic
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and purinergic receptor antagonists .
O O O O O
Generally , atropine reduced contractions , but in contrast to controls , it also reduced responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity ( 1 - 5 Hz ) in inflamed
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
preparations .
O O
In both types , purinoceptor desensitization with alpha , beta - methylene adenosine - 5' - triphosphate ( alpha , beta - meATP ) caused further reductions at low frequencies
O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O B I I I I O O O O O O O
( < 10 Hz ) .
O O O O O O
The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine , 4 - diphenylacetoxy - N - methylpiperidine ( 4 - DAMP ) ( ' M ( 1 ) / M ( 3 ) /
O O O O B O B I I I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
M ( 5 ) - selective ' ) , methoctramine ( ' M ( 2 ) - selective ' ) and pirenzepine ( ' M ( 1 ) - selective
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
' ) antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation - evoked contractile response more potently than the phasic component .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 - DAMP inhibited the tonic contractions in controls more potently than methoctramine and pirenzepine .
B I I O O O O O O O O O B O B O
In inflamed preparations , the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation - evoked contraction was decreased and the pirenzepine and 4 - DAMP antagonism
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O
on the tonic component was much less efficient than in controls .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast to controls , methoctramine increased - - instead of decreased - - the tonic responses at high frequencies .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While contractions to carbachol and ATP were the same in inflamed and in control strips when related to a reference potassium response , isoprenaline - induced relaxations were smaller in
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O
inflamed strips .
O O O
Thus , in cystitis substantial changes of the efferent functional responses occur .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While postjunctional beta - adrenoceptor - mediated relaxations are reduced , effects by prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors may be increased .

Associations between use of benzodiazepines or related drugs and health , physical abilities and cognitive function : a non - randomised clinical study in the elderly .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To describe associations between the use of benzodiazepines or related drugs ( BZDs / RDs ) and health , functional abilities and cognitive function in the elderly .
O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
A non - randomised clinical study of patients aged > or = 65 years admitted to acute hospital wards during 1 month .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
164 patients ( mean age + / -
O O O O O O O O
standard deviation [ SD ] 81 . 6 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O
6 . 8 years ) were admitted .
O O O O O O O O
Of these , nearly half ( n = 78 ) had used BZDs / RDs before admission , and the remainder ( n = 86 ) were non - users
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Cognitive ability was assessed by the Mini - Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients scoring > or = 20 MMSE sum points were interviewed ( n = 79 ) and questioned regarding symptoms and functional abilities during the week prior to admission .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Data on use of BZDs / RDs before admission , current medications and discharge diagnoses were collected from medical records .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Health , physical abilities and cognitive function were compared between BZD / RD users and non - users , and adjustments were made for confounding variables .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The residual serum concentrations of oxazepam , temazepam and zopiclone were analysed .
O O O O O B O B O B O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The mean + / -
O O O O O
SD duration of BZD / RD use was 7 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O
7 years ( range 1 - 31 ) .
O O O O O O O O O
Two or three BZDs / RDs were concomitantly taken by 26 % of users ( n = 20 ) .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Long - term use of these drugs was associated with female sex and use of a higher number of drugs with effects on the CNS , which tended to be
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
related to diagnosed dementia .
O O O O O
After adjustment for these variables as confounders , use of BZDs / RDs was not associated with cognitive function as measured by the MMSE .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , use of BZDs / RDs was associated with dizziness , inability to sleep after awaking at night and tiredness in the mornings during the week prior to admission
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and with stronger depressive symptoms measured at the beginning of the hospital stay .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Use of BZDs / RDs tended to be associated with a reduced ability to walk and shorter night - time sleep during the week prior to admission .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A higher residual serum concentration of temazepam correlated with a lower MMSE sum score after adjustment for confounding variables .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Long - term use and concomitant use of more than one BZD / RD were common in elderly patients hospitalised because of acute illnesses .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Long - term use was associated with daytime and night - time symptoms indicative of poorer health and potentially caused by the adverse effects of these drugs .

O O O O O O O O O O O O
She was not an alcoholic .
O O O O O O
For the first few days after ingestion , she was in a confused state and had mild to moderate ataxia and giddiness .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She noticed hoarseness and distally accentuated motor and sensory dysfunction after she had recovered from this state .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A nerve conduction study was consistent with severe sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy .

Higher optical density of an antigen assay predicts thrombosis in patients with heparin - induced thrombocytopenia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
OBJECTIVES :
O O
To correlate optical density and percent inhibition of a two - step heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) antigen assay with thrombosis ; the assay utilizes reaction inhibition characteristics
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of a high heparin concentration .
O O O B O O
PATIENTS AND METHODS :
O O O O
Patients with more than 50 % decrease in platelet count or thrombocytopenia ( < 150 x 10 ( 9 ) / L ) after exposure to heparin , who had
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
a positive two - step antigen assay [ optical density ( OD ) > 0 . 4 and > 50 inhibition with high concentration of heparin ] were included in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
the study .
O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Forty of 94 HIT patients had thrombosis at diagnosis ; 54 / 94 had isolated - HIT without thrombosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Eight of the isolated - HIT patients developed thrombosis within the next 30 d ; thus , a total of 48 patients had thrombosis at day 30 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At diagnosis there was no significant difference in OD between HIT patients with thrombosis and those with isolated - HIT .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , OD was significantly higher in all patients with thrombosis ( n = 48 , 1 . 34 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
0 . 89 ) , including isolated - HIT patients who later developed thrombosis within 30 d ( n = 8 , 1 . 84 + / - 0 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
64 )
O O
as compared to isolated - HIT patients who did not develop thrombosis ( 0 . 96 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
0 . 75 ; P = 0 . 011 and P = 0 . 008 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Receiver Operative Characteristic Curve showed that OD > 1 . 27 in the isolated - HIT group had a significantly higher chance of developing thrombosis by day 30 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
None of these groups showed significant difference in percent inhibition .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Multivariate analysis showed a 2 . 8 - fold increased risk of thrombosis in females .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Similarly , thrombotic risk increased with age and OD values .
O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Higher OD is associated with significant risk of subsequent thrombosis in patients with isolated - HIT ; percent inhibition , however , was not predictive .

RESULT ( S ) :
O O O O O
A 36 - year - old Chinese woman developed central retinal vein occlusion after eight courses of CC .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
A search of the literature on the thromboembolic complications of CC does not include this severe ophthalmic complication , although mild visual disturbance after CC intake is not uncommon .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
CONCLUSION ( S )
O O O O
: This is the first reported case of central retinal vein occlusion after treatment with CC .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Extra caution is warranted in treating infertility patients with CC , and patients should be well informed of this side effect before commencement of therapy .

Nicotine - induced nystagmus correlates with midpontine activation .
B O O O O O O O O
The pathomechanism of nicotine - induced nystagmus ( NIN ) is unknown .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O
The aim of this study was to delineate brain structures that are involved in NIN generation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Eight healthy volunteers inhaled nicotine in darkness during a functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) experiment ; eye movements were registered using video - oculography .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
NIN correlated with blood oxygen level - dependent ( BOLD ) activity levels in a midpontine site in the posterior basis pontis .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
NIN - induced midpontine activation may correspond to activation of the dorsomedial pontine nuclei and the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis , structures known to participate in the generation of multidirectional
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
saccades and smooth pursuit eye movements .

Protective effect of verapamil on gastric hemorrhagic ulcers in severe atherosclerotic rats .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Studies concerning with pathogenesis of gastric hemorrhage and mucosal ulceration produced in atherosclerotic rats are lacking .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The aim of this study is to examine the role of gastric acid back - diffusion , mast cell histamine release , lipid peroxide ( LPO ) generation and mucosal
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
microvascular permeability in modulating gastric hemorrhage and ulcer in rats with atherosclerosis induced by coadministration of vitamin D2 and cholesterol .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O
Additionally , the protective effect of verapamil on this ulcer model was evaluated .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Male Wistar rats were challenged intragastrically once daily for 9 days with 1 . 0 ml / kg of corn oil containing vitamin D2 and cholesterol to induce atherosclerosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O
Control rats received corn oil only .
O O O O O O O
After gastric surgery , rat stomachs were irrigated for 3 h with either simulated gastric juice or normal saline .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Gastric acid back - diffusion , mucosal LPO generation , histamine concentration , microvascular permeability , luminal hemoglobin content and ulcer areas were determined .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Elevated atherosclerotic parameters , such as serum calcium , total cholesterol and low - density lipoprotein concentration were obtained in atherosclerotic rats .
O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Severe gastric ulcers accompanied with increased ulcerogenic factors , including gastric acid back - diffusion , histamine release , LPO generation and luminal hemoglobin content were also observed in these
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O
rats .
O O
Moreover , a positive correlation of histamine to gastric hemorrhage and to ulcer was found in those atherosclerotic rats .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This hemorrhagic ulcer and various ulcerogenic parameters were dose - dependently ameliorated by daily intragastric verapamil .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Atherosclerosis could produce gastric hemorrhagic ulcer via aggravation of gastric acid back - diffusion , LPO generation , histamine release and microvascular permeability that could be ameliorated by verapamil in

Adriamycin - induced autophagic cardiomyocyte death plays a pathogenic role in a rat model of heart failure .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
The mechanisms underlying heart failure induced by adriamycin are very complicated and still unclear .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The aim of this study was to investigate whether autophagy was involved in the progression of heart failure induced by adriamycin , so that we can develop a novel treatment
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
strategy for heart failure .
O O O O O
METHODS : 3 - methyladenine
O O B I I
( 3MA ) , a specific inhibitor on autophagy was used in a heart failure model of rats induced by adriamycin .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from Sprague - Dawley rat hearts and randomly divided into controls , an adriamycin - treated group , and a 3MA plus adriamycin - treated group
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O B O O O
.
O
We then examined the morphology , expression of beclin 1 gene , mitochondrial permeability transition ( MPT ) , and Na + - K + ATPase activity in vivo .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
We also assessed cell viability , mitochondrial membrane potential changes and counted autophagic vacuoles in cultured cardiomyocytes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , we analyzed the expression of autophagy associated gene , beclin 1 using RT - PCR and Western blotting in an animal model .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
3MA significantly improved cardiac function and reduced mitochondrial injury .
B O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , adriamycin induced the formation of autophagic vacuoles , and 3MA strongly downregulated the expression of beclin 1 in adriamycin - induced failing heart and inhibited the formation of
O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
autophagic vacuoles .
O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Autophagic cardiomyocyte death plays an important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure in rats induced by adriamycin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Mitochondrial injury may be involved in the progression of heart failure caused by adriamycin via the autophagy pathway .

Confusion , a rather serious adverse drug reaction with valproic acid : a review of the French Pharmacovigilance database .
O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O
INTRODUCTION :
O O
Confusion is an adverse drug reaction frequently observed with valproic acid .
O O O O O O O O O B I O
Some case reports are published in the literature but no systematic study from a sample of patients has been published .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We performed this study in order to describe the main characteristics of this adverse drug reaction .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Using the French Pharmacovigilance database , we selected the cases of confusion reported since 1985 with valproic acid .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
RESULTS :
O O
272 cases of confusion were reported with valproic acid : 153 women and 119 men .
O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
Confusion mostly occurred during the two first weeks following valproic acid exposure ( 39 . 7 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
It was """" serious """" for almost 2 / 3 of the patients ( 62 . 5 % ) and its outcome favourable in most of the cases ( 82
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
% ) .
O O O
The occurrence of this ADR was more frequent in patients aged between 61 and 80 years .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
This work shows that confusion with valproic acid is a serious , rather frequent but reversible adverse drug reaction .
O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
It occurs especially in older patients and during the first two weeks of treatment .

Learning and memory deficits in ecstasy users and their neural correlates during a face - learning task .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
It has been consistently shown that ecstasy users display impairments in learning and memory performance .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
In addition , working memory processing in ecstasy users has been shown to be associated with neural alterations in hippocampal and / or cortical regions as measured by functional magnetic
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
O O O O O O
Using functional imaging and a face - learning task , we investigated neural correlates of encoding and recalling face - name associations in 20 recreational drug users whose predominant drug
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
use was ecstasy and 20 controls .
O O B O O O O
To address the potential confounding effects of the cannabis use of the ecstasy using group , a second analysis included 14 previously tested cannabis users ( Nestor , L .

Deficits in learning and memory : parahippocampal hyperactivity and frontocortical hypoactivity in cannabis users .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Neuroimage 40 , 1328 - 1339 ) .
O O O O O O O O
Ecstasy users performed significantly worse in learning and memory compared to controls and cannabis users .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
A conjunction analysis of the encode and recall phases of the task revealed ecstasy - specific hyperactivity in bilateral frontal regions , left temporal , right parietal , bilateral temporal
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, and bilateral occipital brain regions .
O O O O O O O
Ecstasy - specific hypoactivity was evident in the right dorsal anterior cingulated cortex ( ACC ) and left posterior cingulated cortex .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In both ecstasy and cannabis groups brain activation was decreased in the right medial frontal gyrus , left parahippocampal gyrus , left dorsal cingulate gyrus , and left caudate .
O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results elucidated ecstasy - related deficits , only some of which might be attributed to cannabis use .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
These ecstasy - specific effects may be related to the vulnerability of isocortical and allocortical regions to the neurotoxic effects of ecstasy .

Prolonged elevation of plasma argatroban in a cardiac transplant patient with a suspected history of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Direct thrombin inhibitors ( DTIs ) provide an alternative method of anticoagulation for patients with a history of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) or HIT with thrombosis (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
HITT ) undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) .
O O O O O O O O O
In the following report , a 65 - year - old critically ill patient with a suspected history of HITT was administered argatroban for anticoagulation on bypass during heart transplantation
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
.
O
The patient required massive transfusion support ( 55 units of red blood cells , 42 units of fresh - frozen plasma , 40 units of cryoprecipitate , 40 units of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
platelets , and three doses of recombinant Factor VIIa ) for severe intraoperative and postoperative bleeding .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS : Plasma samples from before and
O O O O O O O O O O
after CPB were analyzed postoperatively for argatroban concentration using a modified ecarin clotting time ( ECT ) assay .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Unexpectedly high concentrations of argatroban were measured in these samples ( range , 0 - 32 microg / mL ) , and a prolonged plasma argatroban half life ( t
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
( 1 / 2 ) ) of 514 minutes was observed ( published elimination t ( 1 / 2 ) is 39 - 51 minutes [ < or = 181
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
minutes with hepatic impairment ] ) .
O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Correlation of plasma argatroban concentration versus the patient 's coagulation variables and clinical course suggest that prolonged elevated levels of plasma argatroban may have contributed to the patient 's extended
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
coagulopathy .
O O
Because DTIs do not have reversal agents , surgical teams and transfusion services should remain aware of the possibility of massive transfusion events during anticoagulation with these agents .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is the first report to measure plasma argatroban concentration in the context of CPB and extended coagulopathy .

Antituberculosis therapy - induced acute liver failure : magnitude , profile , prognosis , and predictors of outcome .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Antituberculosis therapy ( ATT ) - associated acute liver failure ( ATT - ALF ) is the commonest drug - induced ALF in South Asia .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Prospective studies on ATT - ALF are lacking .
O O O O O O O O O
The current study prospectively evaluated the magnitude , clinical course , outcome , and prognostic factors in ATT - ALF .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
From January 1986 to January 2009 , 1223 consecutive ALF patients were evaluated : ATT alone was the cause in 70 ( 5 . 7 % ) patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Another 15 ( 1 . 2 % ) had ATT and simultaneous hepatitis virus infection .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 44 ( 62 . 8 % ) patients , ATT was prescribed empirically without definitive evidence of tuberculosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ATT - ALF patients were younger ( 32 . 87 [ + / - 15 . 8 ] years ) , and 49 ( 70 % ) of them were
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
women .
O O
Most had hyperacute presentation ; the median icterus encephalopathy interval was 4 . 5 ( 0 - 30 ) days .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The median duration of ATT before ALF was 30 ( 7 - 350 ) days .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At presentation , advanced encephalopathy and cerebral edema were present in 51 ( 76 % ) and 29 ( 41 . 4 % ) patients , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Gastrointestinal bleed , seizures , infection , and acute renal failure were documented in seven ( 10 % ) , five ( 7 . 1 % ) , 26 (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
37 . 1 % ) , and seven ( 10 % ) patients , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Compared with hepatitis E virus ( HEV ) and non - A non - E - induced ALF , ATT - ALF patients had nearly similar presentations except for older
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
age and less elevation of liver enzymes .
O O O O O O O O
The mortality rate among patients with ATT - ALF was high ( 67 . 1 % , n = 47 ) , and only 23 ( 32 . 9 %
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) patients recovered with medical treatment .
O O O O O O O
In multivariate analysis , three factors independently predicted mortality : serum bilirubin ( > or = 10 . 8 mg / dL ) , prothrombin time ( PT ) prolongation
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( > or = 26 seconds ) , and grade III / IV encephalopathy at presentation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
ATT - ALF constituted 5 . 7 % of ALF at our center and had a high mortality rate .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because the mortality rate is so high , determining which factors are predictors is less important .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A high proportion of patients had consumed ATT empirically , which could have been prevented .

Central nervous system complications during treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a single pediatric institution .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Central nervous system ( CNS ) complications during treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) remain a challenging clinical problem .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Outcome improvement with more intensive chemotherapy has significantly increased the incidence and severity of adverse events .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This study analyzed the incidence of neurological complications during ALL treatment in a single pediatric institution , focusing on clinical , radiological , and electrophysiological findings .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Exclusion criteria included CNS leukemic infiltration at diagnosis , therapy - related peripheral neuropathy , late - onset encephalopathy , or long - term neurocognitive defects .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
During a 9 - year period , we retrospectively collected 27 neurological events ( 11 % ) in as many patients , from 253 children enrolled in the ALL front

O O O O
CNS complications included posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome ( n = 10 ) , stroke ( n = 5 ) , temporal lobe epilepsy ( n = 2 ) , high
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- dose methotrexate toxicity ( n = 2 ) , syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( n = 1 ) , and other unclassified events ( n = 7
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) .
O O
In conclusion , CNS complications are frequent events during ALL therapy , and require rapid detection and prompt treatment to limit permanent damage .

Effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol - induced parkinsonian catalepsy : behavioral and electrophysiological studies .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE : The globus pallidus plays a critical role in movement regulation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Previous studies have indicated that the globus pallidus receives neurotensinergic innervation from the striatum , and systemic administration of a neurotensin analog could produce antiparkinsonian effects .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The present study aimed to investigate the effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol - induced parkinsonian symptoms .
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Behavioral experiments and electrophysiological recordings were performed in the present study .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Bilateral infusions of neurotensin into the globus pallidus reversed haloperidol - induced parkinsonian catalepsy in rats .
O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Electrophysiological recordings showed that microinjection of neurotensin induced excitation of pallidal neurons in the presence of systemic haloperidol administration .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O
The neurotensin type - 1 receptor antagonist SR48692 blocked both the behavioral and the electrophysiological effects induced by neurotensin .
O B I I I I I B O O O O O O O O O O B O
CONCLUSION :

Antihypertensive drugs and depression : a reappraisal .
O O O O O O O O
Eighty - nine new referral hypertensive out - patients and 46 new referral non - hypertensive chronically physically ill out - patients completed a mood rating scale at regular intervals
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for one year .
O O O O
The results showed a high prevalence of depression in both groups of patients , with no preponderance in the hypertensive group .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hypertensive patients with psychiatric histories had a higher prevalence of depression than the comparison patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This was accounted for by a significant number of depressions occurring in methyl dopa treated patients with psychiatric histories .

Pulmonary shunt and cardiovascular responses to CPAP during nitroprusside - induced hypotension .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The effects of continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) on cardiovascular dynamics and pulmonary shunt ( QS / QT ) were investigated in 12 dogs before and during
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sodium nitroprusside infusion that decreased mean arterial blood pressure 40 - 50 per cent .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Before nitroprusside infusion , 5 cm H2O CPAP significantly , P less than . 05 , decreased arterial blood pressure , but did not significantly alter heart rate , cardiac
O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
output , systemic vascular resistance , or QS / QT .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Ten cm H2O CPAP before nitroprusside infusion produced a further decrease in arterial blood pressure and significantly increased heart rate and decreased cardiac output and QS / QT .
O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nitroprusside caused significant decreases in arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance and increases in heart rate , but did not change cardiac output or QS / QT .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Five cm H2O CPAP during nitroprusside did not further alter any of the above - mentioned variables .
O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , 10 cm H2O CPAP decreased arterial blood pressure , cardiac output , and QS / QT .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These data indicate that nitroprusside infusion rates that decrease mean arterial blood pressure by 40 - 50 per cent do not change cardiac output or QS / QT .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
During nitroprusside infusion low levels of CPAP do not markedly alter cardiovascular dynamics , but high levels of CPAP ( 10 cm H2O ) , while decreasing QS / QT
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
, produce marked decreases in arterial blood pressure and cardiac output .

B I I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
L - dopa .
B I I O
Pimozide did not affect the actions of L - dopa on blood pressure and heart rate but completely blocked the enhancement of reflexes .
B O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Removal of the carotid sinuses caused an elevation blood pressure and heart rate and abolished the negative chronotropic effect of norepinephrine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
However , L - dopa restored the bradycardia caused by norepinephrine in addition to decreasing blood pressure and heart rate .
O O B I I O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
5 - HTP ( 5 mg / kg i . v . )
B I I O O O O O O O O O O
decreased blood pressure and heart rate and decreased the reflex bradycardia to norepinephrine .

Cocaine - induced myocardial infarction : clinical observations and pathogenetic considerations .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical and experimental data published to date suggest several possible mechanisms by which cocaine may result in acute myocardial infarction .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
In individuals with preexisting , high - grade coronary arterial narrowing , acute myocardial infarction may result from an increase in myocardial oxygen demand associated with cocaine - induced increase
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O
in rate - pressure product .
O O O O O O
In other individuals with no underlying atherosclerotic obstruction , coronary occlusion may be due to spasm , thrombus , or both .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
With regard to spasm , the clinical findings are largely circumstantial , and the locus of cocaine - induced vasoconstriction remains speculative .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Although certain clinical and experimental findings support the hypothesis that spasm involves the epicardial , medium - size vessels , other data suggest intramural vasoconstriction .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Diffuse intramural vasoconstriction is not consistent with reports of segmental , discrete infarction .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Whereas certain in vivo data suggest that these effects are alpha - mediated , other in vitro data suggest the opposite .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The finding of cocaine - induced vasoconstriction in segments of ( noninnervated ) human umbilical artery suggests that the presence or absence of intact innervation is not sufficient to explain
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the discrepant data involving the possibility of alpha - mediated effects .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Finally , the contribution of a primary , thrombotic effect of cocaine has not been excluded .

Its occurrence in a patient being treated with imipramine is described , representing the first reported case of this syndrome in conjunction with antidepressants .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Repeated cerebral perfusion SPECT scans revealed decreased basal ganglia perfusion while the movement disorder was present , and a return to normal perfusion when the rabbit syndrome resolved .

Acute bronchodilating effects of ipratropium bromide and theophylline in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
O O O O B I O B O O O O O O
The bronchodilator effects of a single dose of ipratropium bromide aerosol ( 36 micrograms ) and short - acting theophylline tablets (
O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O B O O
dose titrated to produce serum levels of 10 - 20 micrograms / mL ) were compared in a double - blind , placebo - controlled crossover study in 21 patients
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with stable , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
O O O O O O O O
Mean peak forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) increases over baseline and the proportion of patients attaining at least a 15 % increase in the FEV1 (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
responders ) were 31 % and 90 % , respectively , for ipratropium and 17 % and 50 % , respectively , for theophylline .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O
The average FEV1 increases during the 6 - hour observation period were 18 % for ipratropium and 8 % for theophylline .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O
The mean duration of action was 3 . 8 hours with ipratropium and 2 . 4 hours with theophylline .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O
While side effects were rare , those experienced after theophylline use did involve the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
These results show that ipratropium is a more potent bronchodilator than oral theophylline in patients with chronic airflow obstruction .

Irreversible damage to the medullary interstitium in experimental analgesic nephropathy in F344 rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Renal papillary necrosis ( RPN ) and a decreased urinary concentrating ability developed during continuous long - term treatment with aspirin and paracetamol in female Fischer 344 rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O
Renal structure and concentrating ability were examined after a recovery period of up to 18 weeks , when no analgesics were given , to investigate whether the analgesic - induced
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
changes were reversible .
O O O O
There was no evidence of repair to the damaged medullary interstitial matrix , or proliferation of remaining undamaged type 1 medullary interstitial cells after the recovery period following analgesic treatment
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
The recovery of urinary concentrating ability was related to the length of analgesic treatment and the extent of the resulting inner medullary structural damage .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
During the early stages of analgesic treatment , the changes in urinary concentrating ability were reversible , but after prolonged analgesic treatment , maximum urinary concentrating ability failed to recover
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
This study shows that prolonged analgesic treatment in Fischer 344 rats causes progressive and irreversible damage to the interstitial matrix and type 1 interstitial cells leading to RPN .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The associated urinary concentrating defect is reversible only during the early stages of structural damage to the inner medulla .

Less frequent lithium administration and lower urine volume .
O O B O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE : This study was designed to determine whether patients maintained on a regimen of lithium on a once - per - day schedule have lower urine volumes than do
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
patients receiving multiple doses per day .
O O O O O O O
METHOD :
O O
This was a cross - sectional study of 85 patients from a lithium clinic who received different dose schedules .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Patients were admitted to the hospital for measurement of lithium level , creatinine clearance , urine volume , and maximum osmolality .
O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Multiple daily doses of lithium were associated with higher urine volumes .
O O O O B O O O O O O O
The dosing schedule , duration of lithium treatment , and daily dose of lithium did not affect maximum osmolality or creatinine clearance .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Urine volume can be reduced by giving lithium once daily and / or by lowering the total daily dose .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lithium - induced polyuria seems to be related to extrarenal as well as to renal effects .

Effect of adriamycin combined with whole body hyperthermia on tumor and normal tissues .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Thermal enhancement of Adriamycin - mediated antitumor activity and normal tissue toxicities by whole body hyperthermia were compared using a F344 rat model .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Antitumor activity was studied using a tumor growth delay assay .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Acute normal tissue toxicities ( i . e . , leukopenia and thrombocytopenia ) and late normal tissue toxicities ( i . e . , myocardial and kidney injury )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
were evaluated by functional / physiological assays and by morphological techniques .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Whole body hyperthermia ( 120 min at 41 . 5 degrees C ) enhanced both Adriamycin - mediated antitumor activity and toxic side effects .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
The thermal enhancement ratio calculated for antitumor activity was 1 . 6 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thermal enhancement ratios estimated for """" acute """" hematological changes were 1 . 3 , whereas those estimated for """" late """" damage ( based on morphological cardiac and renal
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lesions ) varied between 2 . 4 and 4 . 3 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , while whole body hyperthermia enhances Adriamycin - mediated antitumor effect , normal tissue toxicity is also increased , and the potential therapeutic gain of the combined modality treatment
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
is eroded .

Prazosin - induced stress incontinence .
B O O O O O
A case of genuine stress incontinence due to prazosin , a common antihypertensive drug , is presented .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Prazosin exerts its antihypertensive effects through vasodilatation caused by selective blockade of postsynaptic alpha - 1 adrenergic receptors .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As an alpha - blocker , it also exerts a significant relaxant effect on the bladder neck and urethra .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient 's clinical course is described and correlated with initial urodynamic studies while on prazosin and subsequent studies while taking verapamil .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O
Her incontinence resolved with the change of medication .
O O O O O O O O O
The restoration of continence was accompanied by a substantial rise in maximum urethral pressure , maximum urethral closure pressure , and functional urethral length .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients who present with stress incontinence while taking prazosin should change their antihypertensive medication before considering surgery , because their incontinence may resolve spontaneously with a change in drug therapy

Fluoxetine - induced akathisia : clinical and theoretical implications .
B O O O O O O O O O
Five patients receiving fluoxetine for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder or major depression developed akathisia .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The typical fluoxetine - induced symptoms of restlessness , constant pacing , purposeless movements of the feet and legs , and marked anxiety were indistinguishable from those of neuroleptic -
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
induced akathisia .
O O O
Three patients who had experienced neuroleptic - induced akathisia in the past reported that the symptoms of fluoxetine - induced akathisia were identical , although somewhat milder .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Akathisia appeared to be a common side effect of fluoxetine and generally responded well to treatment with the beta - adrenergic antagonist propranolol , dose reduction , or both .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The authors suggest that fluoxetine - induced akathisia may be caused by serotonergically mediated inhibition of dopaminergic neurotransmission and that the pathophysiology of fluoxetine - induced akathisia and tricyclic
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
antidepressant - induced """" jitteriness """" may be identical .

Stroke associated with cocaine use .
O O O B O O
We describe eight patients in whom cocaine use was related to stroke and review 39 cases from the literature .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Among these 47 patients the mean ( + / - SD ) age was 32 . 5 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
12 . 1 years ; 76 % ( 34 / 45 ) were men .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Stroke followed cocaine use by inhalation , intranasal , intravenous , and intramuscular routes .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Intracranial aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations were present in 17 of 32 patients studied angiographically or at autopsy ; cerebral vasculitis was present in two patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cerebral infarction occurred in 10 patients ( 22 % ) , intracerebral hemorrhage in 22 ( 49 % ) , and subarachnoid hemorrhage in 13 ( 29 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These data indicate that ( 1 ) the apparent incidence of stroke related to cocaine use is increasing ; ( 2 ) cocaine - associated stroke occurs primarily in young
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
adults ; ( 3 ) stroke may follow any route of cocaine administration ; ( 4 ) stroke after cocaine use is frequently associated with intracranial aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
; and ( 5 ) in cocaine - associated stroke , the frequency of intracranial hemorrhage exceeds that of cerebral infarction .

Drug - induced hepatotoxicity , although common , has been reported only infrequently with sulfonylureas .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
For glyburide , a second - generation sulfonylurea , only two brief reports of hepatotoxicity exist .

Systolic pressure variation is greater during hemorrhage than during sodium nitroprusside - induced hypotension in ventilated dogs .
O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
The systolic pressure variation ( SPV ) , which is the difference between the maximal and minimal values of the systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) after one positive -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pressure breath , was studied in ventilated dogs subjected to hypotension .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mean arterial pressure was decreased to 50 mm Hg for 30 minutes either by hemorrhage ( HEM , n = 7 ) or by continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
SNP , n = 7 ) .
B O O O O O O
During HEM - induced hypotension the cardiac output was significantly lower and systemic vascular resistance higher compared with that in the SNP group .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
The systemic , central venous , pulmonary capillary wedge pressures , and heart rates , were similar in the two groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Analysis of the respiratory changes in the arterial pressure waveform enabled differentiation between the two groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The SPV during hypotension was 15 . 7 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O
6 . 7 mm Hg in the HEM group , compared with 9 . 1 + / -

2 . 0 mm Hg in the SNP group ( P less than 0 . 02 ) .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
The delta down , which is the measure of decrease of SBP after a mechanical breath , was 20 . 3 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8 . 4 and 10 . 1 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O
3 . 8 mm Hg in the HEM and SNP groups , respectively , during hypotension ( P less than 0 . 02 ) .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is concluded that increases in the SPV and the delta down are characteristic of a hypotensive state due to a predominant decrease in preload .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are thus more important during absolute hypovolemia than during deliberate hypotension .

O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by a 30 - min recovery period .
O O O O O O O O
A second group of rats was treated identically and , in addition , received an infusion of saralasin ( a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin II ) throughout the experimental period
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I O O O O O
.
O
In each group , SNP infusion resulted in an initial decrease in blood pressure from 86 torr and 83 torr , respectively , to 48 torr .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
During the SNP infusion the control animals demonstrated a progressive increase in blood pressure to 61 torr , whereas the saralasin - treated animals showed no change .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Following discontinuation of SNP , blood pressure in the control animals rebounded to 94 torr , as compared with 78 torr in the saralasin - treated rats .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
This study indicates that with stable halothane anesthesia , the partial recovery of blood pressure during SNP infusion and the post - SNP rebound of blood pressure can be completely
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O
blocked by saralasin .
O O B O
This demonstrates the participation of the renin - - angiotensin system in antagonizing the combined hypotensive effects of halothane and SNP .

Toxic hepatitis induced by antithyroid drugs : four cases including one with cross - reactivity between carbimazole and benzylthiouracil .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
OBJECTIVE : This study was conducted to assess the occurrence of hepatic adverse effects encountered with antithyroid drugs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Retrospective review of medical records of 236 patients with hyperthyroidism admitted in our department ( in - or out - patients ) from 1986 to 1992 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Four patients ( 1 . 7 % ) were identified with toxic hepatitis which could reasonably be attributed to the use of antithyroid agent .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two patients had a cholestatic hepatitis induced by carbimazole ( N omercazole ) .
O O O O O O O O B O B I O O
Two others had a mixed ( cholestatic and cytolytic ) hepatitis following carbimazole .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
One of the latter two patients further experienced a cytolytic hepatitis which appeared after Benzylthiouracil ( Basd ne ) had replaced carbimazole .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I O O O B O
Biological features of hepatitis disappeared in all cases after cessation of the incriminated drug , while biliary , viral and immunological searches were negative .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Only 2 patients of our retrospective study experienced a mild or severe neutropenia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Toxic hepatitis is a potential adverse effect of antithyroid drugs which warrants , as for haematological disturbances , a pre - therapeutic determination and a careful follow - up of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
relevant biological markers .
O O O O
Moreover , hepatotoxicity may not be restricted to one class of antithyroid agents .

Study of the role of vitamin B12 and folinic acid supplementation in preventing hematologic toxicity of zidovudine .
O O O O O B I O B I O O O O O O B O
A prospective , randomized study was conducted to evaluate the role of vitamin B12 and folinic acid supplementation in preventing zidovudine ( ZDV ) - induced bone marrow suppression .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I O O O B O B O O O O O O O
Seventy - five human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) - infected patients with CD4 + cell counts < 500 / mm3 were randomized to receive either ZDV ( 500 mg
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
daily ) alone ( group I , n = 38 ) or in combination with folinic acid ( 15 mg daily ) and intramascular vitamin B12 ( 1000 micrograms monthly
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O B I O O O O
) ( group II , n = 37 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O
Finally , 15 patients were excluded from the study ( noncompliance 14 , death 1 ) ; thus , 60 patients ( 31 in group I and 29 in group
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
II ) were eligible for analysis .
O O O O O O O
No significant differences between groups were found at enrollment .
O O O O O O O O O O
During the study , vitamin B12 and folate levels were significantly higher in group II patients ; however , no differences in hemoglobin , hematocrit , mean corpuscular volume ,
O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and white - cell , neutrophil and platelet counts were observed between groups at 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 months .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Severe hematologic toxicity ( neutrophil count < 1000 / mm3
O O O O O O O O O O
and / or hemoglobin < 8 g / dl ) occurred in 4 patients assigned to group
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I and 7 assigned to group II .
O O O O O O O O
There was no correlation between vitamin B12 or folate levels and development of myelosuppression .
O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O
Vitamin B12 and folinic acid supplementation of ZDV therapy does not seem useful in preventing or reducing ZDV - induced myelotoxicity in the overall treated population , although a beneficial
B I O B I O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
effect in certain subgroups of patients can not be excluded .

Acute confusion induced by a high - dose infusion of 5 - fluorouracil and folinic acid .
O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I O
A 61 - year - old man was treated with combination chemotherapy incorporating cisplatinum , etoposide , high - dose 5 - fluorouracil ( 2 , 250 mg / m2
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
/ 24 hours ) and folinic acid for an inoperable gastric adenocarcinoma .
O O O O O B I O O O O O O
He developed acute neurologic symptoms of mental confusion , disorientation and irritability , and then lapsed into a deep coma , lasting for approximately 40 hours during the first dose
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( day 2 ) of 5 - fluorouracil and folinic acid infusion .
O O O O O B I I O B I O O
This complication reappeared on day 25 during the second dose of 5 - fluorouracil and folinic acid , which were then the only drugs given .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I O O O O O O O O O
Because folinic acid was unlikely to be associated with this condition , neurotoxicity due to high - dose 5 - fluorouracil was highly suspected .
O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O
The pathogenesis of 5 - fluorouracil neurotoxicity may be due to a Krebs cycle blockade by fluoroacetate and fluorocitrate , thiamine deficiency , or dihydrouracil dehydrogenase deficiency .
O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O B O O O
High - dose 5 - fluorouracil / folinic acid infusion therapy has recently become a popular regimen for various cancers .
O O O B I I O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is necessary that both oncologists and neurologists be fully aware of this unusual complication .

Effect of switching carbamazepine to oxcarbazepine on the plasma levels of neuroleptics .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O
A case report .
O O O O
Carbamazepine was switched to its 10 - keto analogue oxcarbazepine among six difficult - to - treat schizophrenic or organic psychotic patients using concomitantly haloperidol , chlorpromazine or clozapine .
B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O
This change resulted within 2 - 4 weeks in the 50 - 200 % increase in the plasma levels of these neuroleptics and the appearance of extrapyramidal symptoms .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
None of the patients showed any clinical deteriotation during the following 3 - 6 months .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results of this case report support the idea that in contrast with carbamazepine oxcarbazepine does not induce the hepatic microsomal enzyme systems regulating the inactivation of antipsychotic drugs .

Erythema multiforme and hypersensitivity myocarditis caused by ampicillin .
O O O O O O O B O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To report a case of erythema multiforme and hypersensitivity myocarditis caused by ampicillin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
CASE SUMMARY :
O O O
A 13 - year - old boy was treated with ampicillin and gentamicin because of suspected septicemia .
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
Medications were discontinued when erythema multiforme and congestive heart failure caused by myocarditis occurred .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient was treated with methylprednisolone and gradually improved .
O O O O O B O O O O
Macrophage - migration inhibition ( MIF ) test with ampicillin was positive .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O
DISCUSSION :
O O
After most infections causing erythema multiforme and myocarditis were ruled out , a drug - induced allergic reaction was suspected .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Positive MIF test for ampicillin showed sensitization of the patient 's lymphocytes to ampicillin .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Hypersensitivity myocarditis is a rare and dangerous manifestation of allergy to penicillins .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Immediate allergic reactions to amoxicillin .
O O O O B O
A large group of patients with suspected allergic reactions to beta - lactam antibiotics was evaluated .
O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O
A detailed clinical history , together with skin tests , RAST ( radioallergosorbent test ) , and controlled challenge tests , was used to establish whether patients allergic to
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
beta - lactam antibiotics had selective immediate allergic responses to amoxicillin ( AX ) or were cross - reacting with other penicillin derivatives .
B I I O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O B O O
Skin tests were performed with benzylpenicilloyl - poly - L - lysine ( BPO - PLL ) , benzylpenicilloate , benzylpenicillin ( PG ) , ampicillin ( AMP ) ,
O O O O O B I I I I I I O B I I O O B O B O B O O B O B O O
and AX .
O B O
RAST for BPO - PLL and AX - PLL was done .
O O B I I O B O O O O O
When both skin test and RAST for BPO were negative , single - blind , placebo - controlled challenge tests were done to ensure tolerance of PG or sensitivity to
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
AX .
B O
A total of 177 patients were diagnosed as allergic to beta - lactam antibiotics .
O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
We selected the 54 ( 30 . 5 % ) cases of immediate AX allergy with good tolerance of PG .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O
Anaphylaxis was seen in 37 patients ( 69 % ) , the other 17 ( 31 % ) having urticaria and / or angioedema .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All the patients were skin test negative to BPO ; 49 of 51 ( 96 % ) were also negative to MDM , and 44 of 46 ( 96 %
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) to PG .
O O B O
Skin tests with AX were positive in 34 ( 63 % ) patients .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
RAST was positive for AX in 22 patients ( 41 % ) and to BPO in just 5 ( 9 % ) .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
None of the sera with negative RAST for AX were positive to BPO .
O O O O O O O O B O O O B O
Challenge tests with AX were performed in 23 subjects ( 43 % ) to establish the diagnosis of immediate allergic reaction to AX , and in 15 cases ( 28
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
% ) both skin test and RAST for AX were negative .
O O O O O O O O B O O O
PG was well tolerated by all 54 patients .
B O O O O O O O O
We describe the largest group of AX - allergic patients who have tolerated PG reported so far .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O
Diagnosis of these patients can be achieved only if specific AX - related reagents are employed .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Further studies are necessary to determine the exact extent of this problem and to improve the efficacy of diagnostic methods .

Persistent paralysis after prolonged use of atracurium in the absence of corticosteroids .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Neuromuscular blocking agents ( NMBAs ) are often used for patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Reports of persistent paralysis after the discontinuance of these drugs have most often involved aminosteroid - based NMBAs such as vecuronium bromide , especially when used in conjunction with corticosteroids
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
.
O
Atracurium besylate , a short - acting benzylisoquinolinium NMBA that is eliminated independently of renal or hepatic function , has also been associated with persistent paralysis , but only when
B I O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
used with corticosteroids .
O O O O
We report a case of atracurium - related paralysis persisting for approximately 50 hours in a patient who was not treated with corticosteroids .

Habitual use of acetaminophen as a risk factor for chronic renal failure : a comparison with phenacetin .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Six epidemiologic studies in the United States and Europe indicate that habitual use of phenacetin is associated with the development of chronic renal failure and end - stage renal disease
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( ESRD ) , with a relative risk in the range of 4 to 19 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As a result of these and other studies , phenacetin has now been withdrawn from the market in most countries .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
However , three case control studies , one each in North Carolina , northern Maryland , and West Berlin , Germany , showed that habitual use of acetaminophen is also
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
associated with chronic renal failure and ESRD , with a relative risk in the range of 2 to 4 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These studies suggest that both phenacetin and acetaminophen may contribute to the burden of ESRD , with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former
O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
This apparent difference in risk may not be due to differences in nephrotoxic potential of the drugs themselves .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A lower relative risk would be expected for acetaminophen if the risk of both drugs in combination with other analgesics was higher than the risk of either agent alone .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , acetaminophen has been used both as a single agent and in combination with other analgesics , whereas phenacetin was available only in combinations .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The possibility that habitual use of acetaminophen alone increases the risk of ESRD has not been clearly demonstrated , but can not be dismissed .

Reduction of heparan sulphate - associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane of rats with streptozotocin - induced diabetic nephropathy .
O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Heparan sulphate - associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane were studied in rats 8 months after induction of diabetes by streptozotocin and in age - adn sex -
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
matched control rats , employing the cationic dye cuprolinic blue .
O O O O O O O O B I O
Morphometric analysis at the ultrastructural level was performed using a computerized image processor .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The heparan sulphate specificity of the cuprolinic blue staining was demonstrated by glycosaminoglycan - degrading enzymes , showing that pretreatment of the sections with heparitinase abolished all staining , whereas
O B I O O O B I O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
chondroitinase ABC had no effect .
O O O O O O
The majority of anionic sites ( 74 % in diabetic and 81 % in control rats ) were found within the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A minority of anionic sites were scattered throughout the lamina densa and lamina rara interna , and were significantly smaller than those in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
basement membrane ( p < 0 . 001 and p < 0 . 01 for diabetic and control rats , respectively ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Diabetic rats progressively developed albuminuria reaching 40 . 3 ( 32 . 2 - 62 . 0 ) mg / 24
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
h after 8 months in contrast to the control animals ( 0 . 8 ( 0 . 2 - 0 . 9 ) mg / 24 h , p <
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
0 . 002 ) .
O O O O O
At the same time , the number of heparan sulphate anionic sites and the total anionic site surface ( number of anionic sites x mean anionic site surface ) in
O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane was reduced by 19 % ( p < 0 . 021 ) and by 26 % ( p < 0 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
02 ) , respectively .
O O O O O
Number and total anionic site surface in the remaining part of the glomerular basement membrane ( lamina densa and lamina rara interna ) were not significantly changed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We conclude that in streptozotocin - diabetic rats with an increased urinary albumin excretion , a reduced heparan sulphate charge barrier / density is found at the lamina rara externa
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
of the glomerular basement membrane .

Effect of some anticancer drugs and combined chemotherapy on renal toxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The nephrotoxic action of anticancer drugs such as nitrogranulogen ( NG ) , methotrexate ( MTX ) , 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) and cyclophosphamide (
O O O O O O O O B O B O O B O B O O B I I O B I I O O B O
CY ) administered alone or in combination [ MTX + 5 - FU + CY ( CMF ) ] was evaluated in experiments on Wistar rats .
B O O O O O O O B O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
After drug administration , creatinine concentrations in the plasma and in the urine of the rats were determined , as well as creatinine clearance .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Histopathologic evaluation of the kidneys was also performed .
O O O O O O O O O
After MTX administration a significant increase ( p = 0 . 0228 ) in the plasma creatinine concentration and a significant ( p = 0 . 0001 ) decrease in
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
creatinine clearance was noted compared to controls .
B O O O O O O O
After the administration of NG , 5 - FU and CY neither a statistically significant increase in creatinine concentration nor an increase in creatinine clearance was observed compared to the
O O O O B O B I I O B O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O
group receiving no cytostatics .
O O O O O
Following polytherapy according to the CMF regimen , a statistically significant decrease ( p = 0 . 0343 ) in creatinine clearance was found , but creatinine concentration did not
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O
increase significantly compared to controls .
O O O O O O
CY caused hemorrhagic cystitis in 40 % of rats , but it did not cause this complication when combined with 5 - FU and MTX .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O
Histologic changes were found in rat kidneys after administration of MTX , CY and NG , while no such change was observed after 5 - FU and joint administration of
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O
MTX + 5 - FU + CY compared to controls .
B O B I I O B O O O O
Our studies indicate that nephrotoxicity of MTX + 5 - FU + CY administered jointly is lower than in monotherapy .

Lithium - associated cognitive and functional deficits reduced by a switch to divalproex sodium : a case series .
B O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Lithium remains a first - line treatment for the acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although much has been written about the management of the more common adverse effects of lithium , such as polyuria and tremor , more subtle lithium side effects such as
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
cognitive deficits , loss of creativity , and functional impairments remain understudied .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This report summarizes our experience in switching bipolar patients from lithium to divalproex sodium to alleviate such cognitive and functional impairments .
O O O O O O O O O O B O B I O O O O O O O O
METHOD :
O O
Open , case series design .
O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
We report seven cases where substitution of lithium , either fully or partially , with divalproex sodium was extremely helpful in reducing the cognitive , motivational , or creative deficits
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
attributed to lithium in our bipolar patients .
O O B O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
In this preliminary report , divalproex sodium was a superior alternative to lithium in bipolar patients experiencing cognitive deficits , loss of creativity , and functional impairments .

Treatment of previously treated metastatic breast cancer by mitoxantrone and 48 - hour continuous infusion of high - dose 5 - FU and leucovorin ( MFL ) : low palliative
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O B O O O O
benefit and high treatment - related toxicity .
O O O O O O O O
For previously treated advanced breast cancer , there is no standard second - line therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Combination chemotherapy with mitoxantrone , high - dose 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) and leucovorin ( MFL regimen ) had been reported as an effective and well
O O O B O O O O B I I O B I I O O B O B I O O O O O O O O O
tolerated regimen .
O O O
From October 1993 to November 1995 , we treated 13 patients with previously chemotherapy - treated metastatic breast cancer by mitoxantrone , 12 mg / m2 , on day 1
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
and continuous infusion of 5 - FU , 3000 mg / m2 , together with leucovorin , 300 mg / m2 , for 48 h from day 1 to 2
O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Each course of chemotherapy was given every 4 weeks .
O O O O O O O O O O
Most of these patients had more than two metastatic sites , with lung metastasis predominant .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Seven patients had been treated with anthracycline .
O O O O O O B O
Seven patients had previously received radiotherapy and seven had received hormone therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Median number of courses of MFL regimen given was six and the median cumulative dose of mitoxantrone was
O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O B O
68 . 35 mg / m2 .
O O O O O O O
One patient had complete response , seven had stable disease , none had partial response and five had progressive disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The overall objective response rate was 7 . 6 % .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The median follow - up period was 14 months .
O O O O O O O O O O
Median survival was 16 months .
O O O O O O
Median progression - free survival was 5 months .
O O O O O O O O O
A complete responder had relapse - free survival up to 17 months .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Major toxicities were cardiotoxicity and leukopenia .
O O O O O O O
Eight patients were dead in the last follow - up ; two of them died of treatment - related toxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The MFL regimen achieves little palliative benefit and induces severe toxicity at a fairly high rate .
O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Administration of this regimen to breast cancer patients who have been treated by chemotherapy and those with impaired heart function requires careful attention .

The Li - treated rats produced a large volume of hypotonic urine with low ionic concentrations .

Plasma sodium concentrations were found to be slightly increased in the Li - treated rats compared with those in controls .

woman .
O O
Five days after the onset of the symptoms of meningitis , the patient aspirated stomach contents and needed endotracheal intubation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Forty seconds after injection of suxamethonium , bradycardia and cardiac arrest occurred .

An unusual toxic reaction to axillary block by mepivacaine with adrenaline .
O O O O O O O O B O B O
An increase in blood pressure , accompanied by atrial fibrillation , agitation , incomprehensible shouts and loss of consciousness , was observed in an elderly , ASA classification group II
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, cardiovascularly medicated male , 12 min after performance of axillary block with mepivacaine 850 mg containing adrenaline 0 . 225 mg , for correction of Dupuytren 's contracture .

Clinical and histopathologic examination of renal allografts treated with tacrolimus ( FK506 ) for at least one year .
O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
We clinically and pathologically analyzed renal allografts from 1 9 renal transplant patients treated with tacrolimus ( FK506 ) for more than 1 year .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Twenty - six renal allograft biopsy specimens from 1 9 renal transplant patients who underwent transplantations between 1991 and 1993 were evaluated .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thirteen biopsies were performed from stable functioning renal allografts with informed consent ( nonepisode biopsy ) and the other 13 were from dysfunctional renal allografts with a clinical indication for
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
biopsy ( episode biopsy ) .
O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The main pathologic diagnoses ( some overlap ) were acute rejection ( AR ; n = 4 ) , chronic rejection ( CR ; n = 5 ) , AR
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
+ CR ( n = 4 ) , recurrent IgA nephropathy ( n = 5 ) , normal findings ( n = 2 ) , minimal - type chronic
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
FK506 nephropathy ( n = 9 ) , and mild - type FK506 nephropathy ( n = 11 ) .
B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Of the nonepisode biopsies , 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal - type and mild - type chronic FK506 nephropathy , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Chronic FK506 nephropathy consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization ( 5 biopsies ) , arteriolopathy ( angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall ; 20 biopsies ) , focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( 4 biopsies ) and the striped form of interstitial fibrosis ( 11 biopsies ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The serum creatinine levels of patients in the mild - type chronic FK506 nephropathy group , which included 7 episode biopsies , were statistically higher than those in the minimum
O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- type chronic FK506 - nephropathy group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
This study demonstrates that chronic FK506 nephropathy consists primarily of arteriolopathy manifesting as insudative hyalinosis of the arteriolar wall , and suggests that mild - type chronic FK506 nephropathy is
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function .

Memory facilitation and stimulation of endogenous nerve growth factor synthesis by the acetylcholine releaser PG - 9 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O
The effects of PG - 9 ( 3alpha - tropyl 2 - ( p - bromophenyl ) propionate ) , the acetylcholine releaser , on memory processes and nerve growth
O O O B I I O B I I I I I I I I I I O O O B O O O O O O O O
factor ( NGF ) synthesis were evaluated .
O O O O O O O O
In the mouse passive - avoidance test , PG - 9 ( 10 - 30 mg / kg , i . p . ) , administered 20 min before the
O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
training session , prevented amnesia induced by both the non selective antimuscarinic drug scopolamine and the M1 - selective antagonist S - ( - ) - ET - 126 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O
In the same experimental conditions , PG - 9 ( 5 - 20 microg per mouse , i . c . v . ) was also able to prevent antimuscarine
O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- induced amnesia , demonstrating a central localization of the activity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
At the highest effective doses , PG - 9 did not produce any collateral symptoms as revealed by the Irwin test , and it did not modify spontaneous motility and
O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
inspection activity , as revealed by the hole - board test .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
PG - 9 was also able to increase the amount of NGF secreted in vitro by astrocytes in a dose - dependent manner .
B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The maximal NGF contents obtained by PG - 9 were 17 . 6 - fold of the control value .
O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
During culture , no morphological changes were found at effective concentrations of PG - 9 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
The current work indicates the ability of PG - 9 to induce beneficial effects on cognitive processes and stimulate activity of NGF synthesis in astroglial cells .
O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , PG - 9 could represent a potential useful drug able to improve the function of impaired cognitive processes .

Recurarization in the recovery room .
O O O O O O
A case of recurarization in the recovery room is reported .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Accumulation of atracurium in the intravenous line led to recurarization after flushing the line in the recovery room .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A respiratory arrest with severe desaturation and bradycardia occurred .
O O O O O O O O O O
Circumstances leading to this event and the mechanisms enabling a neuromuscular blockade to occur , following the administration of a small dose of relaxant , are discussed .

Recurrent use of newer oral contraceptives and the risk of venous thromboembolism .
O O O O B I O O O O O O O
The epidemiological studies that assessed the risk of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) associated with newer oral contraceptives ( OC ) did not distinguish between patterns of OC use ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O B O O
namely first - time users , repeaters and switchers .
O O O O O O O O O O
Data from a Transnational case - control study were used to assess the risk of VTE for the latter patterns of use , while accounting for duration of use .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Over the period 1993 - 1996 , 551 cases of VTE were identified in Germany and the UK along with 2066 controls .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Totals of 128 cases and 650 controls were analysed for repeat use and 135 cases and 622 controls for switching patterns .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The adjusted rate ratio of VTE for repeat users of third generation OC was 0 . 6 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 3 - 1 . 2 )
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
relative to repeat users of second generation pills , whereas it was 1 . 3 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 7 - 2 . 4 ) for switchers
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
from second to third generation pills relative to switchers from third to second generation pills .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We conclude that second and third generation agents are associated with equivalent risks of VTE when the same agent is used repeatedly after interruption periods or when users are switched
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
between the two generations of pills .
O O O O O O O
These analyses suggest that the higher risk observed for the newer OC in other studies may be the result of inadequate comparisons of pill users with different patterns of pill
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
use .

Development of apomorphine - induced aggressive behavior : comparison of adult male and female Wistar rats .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The development of apomorphine - induced ( 1 . 0 mg / kg s . c .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once daily ) aggressive behavior of adult male and female Wistar rats obtained from the same breeder was studied in two consecutive sets .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In male animals , repeated apomorphine treatment induced a gradual development of aggressive behavior as evidenced by the increased intensity of aggressiveness and shortened latency before the first attack toward
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the opponent .
O O O
In female rats , only a weak tendency toward aggressiveness was found .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In conclusion , the present study demonstrates gender differences in the development of the apomorphine - induced aggressive behavior and indicates that the female rats do not fill the validation

criteria for use in this method .

Serotonergic antidepressants and urinary incontinence .
B I O O O O
Many new serotonergic antidepressants have been introduced over the past decade .
O O B I O O O O O O O O
Although urinary incontinence is listed as one side effect of these drugs in their package inserts there is only one report in the literature .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This concerns 2 male patients who experienced incontinence while taking venlafaxine .
O O O O O O O O O O B O
In the present paper the authors describe 2 female patients who developed incontinence secondary to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors paroxetine and sertraline , as well as a third who
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O B O O O O O O O
developed this side effect on venlafaxine .
O O O O O B O
In 2 of the 3 cases the patients were also taking lithium carbonate and beta - blockers , both of which could have contributed to the incontinence .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Animal studies suggest that incontinence secondary to serotonergic antidepressants could be mediated by the 5HT4 receptors found on the bladder .
O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
Further research is needed to delineate the frequency of this troubling side effect and how best to treat it .

Hypotension following the initiation of tizanidine in a patient treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor for chronic hypertension .
O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Centrally acting alpha - 2 adrenergic agonists are one of several pharmacologic agents used in the treatment of spasticity related to disorders of the central nervous system .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition to their effects on spasticity , certain adverse cardiorespiratory effects have been reported .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Adults chronically treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may have a limited ability to respond to hypotension when the sympathetic response is simultaneously blocked .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The authors present a 10 - year - old boy chronically treated with lisinopril , an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor , to control hypertension who developed hypotension following the addition
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of tizanidine , an alpha - 2 agonist , for the treatment of spasticity .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The possible interaction of tizanidine and other antihypertensive agents should be kept in mind when prescribing therapy to treat either hypertension or spasticity in such patients .

Peritubular capillary basement membrane reduplication in allografts and native kidney disease : a clinicopathologic study of 278 consecutive renal specimens .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
An association has been found between transplant glomerulopathy ( TG ) and reduplication of peritubular capillary basement membranes ( PTCR ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although such an association is of practical and theoretical importance , only one prospective study has tried to confirm it .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
We examined 278 consecutive renal specimens ( from 135 transplants and 143 native kidneys ) for ultrastructural evidence of PTCR .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition to renal allografts with TG , we also examined grafts with acute rejection , recurrent glomerulonephritis , chronic allograft nephropathy and stable grafts ( """" protocol biopsies """"
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) .
O O
Native kidney specimens included a wide range of glomerulopathies as well as cases of thrombotic microangiopathy , malignant hypertension , acute interstitial nephritis , and acute tubular necrosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
We found PTCR in 14 of 15 cases of TG , in 7 transplant biopsy specimens without TG , and in 13 of 143 native kidney biopsy specimens .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These 13 included cases of malignant hypertension , thrombotic microangiopathy , lupus nephritis , Henoch - Schonlein nephritis , crescentic glomerulonephritis , and cocaine - related acute renal failure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Mild PTCR in allografts without TG did not predict renal failure or significant proteinuria after follow - up periods of between 3 months and 1 year .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
We conclude that in transplants , there is a strong association between well - developed PTCR and TG , while the significance of mild PTCR and its predictive value in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the absence of TG is unclear .
O O O O O O O
PTCR also occurs in certain native kidney diseases , though the association is not as strong as that for TG .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We suggest that repeated endothelial injury , including immunologic injury , may be the cause of this lesion both in allografts and native kidneys .

O O O O O O
Competition binding assays demonstrated that all three compounds have high affinities for sigma1 receptors .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The three compounds vary in their affinities for sigma2 receptors and exhibit negligible affinities for dopamine , opioid , GABA ( A ) and NMDA receptors .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O B O O
In behavioral studies , pre - treatment of mice with BD1018 , BD1063 , or LR132 significantly attenuated cocaine - induced convulsions and lethality .
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O B O O B O O O O O O
Moreover , post - treatment with LR132 prevented cocaine - induced lethality in a significant proportion of animals .
O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast to the protection provided by the putative antagonists , the well - characterized sigma receptor agonist di - o - tolylguanidine ( DTG ) and the novel sigma

each worsened the behavioral toxicity of cocaine .
O O O O O O B O
At doses where alone , they produced no significant effects on locomotion , BD1018 , BD1063 and LR132 significantly attenuated the locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O B O
To further validate the hypothesis that the anti - cocaine effects of the novel ligands involved antagonism of sigma receptors , an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against sigma1 receptors was also shown
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
to significantly attenuate the convulsive and locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine .
O O O O O O O O O O B O
Together , the data suggests that functional antagonism of sigma receptors is capable of attenuating a number of cocaine - induced behaviors .

Torsades de pointes ( TDP ) is a potentially fatal ventricular tachycardia associated with increases in QT interval and monophasic action potential duration ( MAPD ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
TDP is a side - effect that has led to withdrawal of several drugs from the market ( e . g . terfenadine and terodiline ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O
2 .
O O
The potential of compounds to cause TDP was evaluated by monitoring their effects on MAPD in dog .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Four compounds known to increase QT interval and cause TDP were investigated : terfenadine , terodiline , cisapride and E4031 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O B O
On the basis that only free drug in the systemic circulation will elicit a pharmacological response target , free concentrations in plasma were selected to mimic the free drug exposures
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in man .
O O O
Infusion regimens were designed that rapidly achieved and maintained target - free concentrations of these drugs in plasma and data on the relationship between free concentration and changes in MAPD
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
were obtained for these compounds .
O O O O O O
3 .
O O
These data indicate that the free ED50 in plasma for terfenadine ( 1 . 9 nM ) , terodiline ( 76 nM ) , cisapride ( 11 nM ) and
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O
E4031 ( 1 . 9 nM ) closely correlate with the free concentration in man causing QT effects .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For compounds that have shown TDP in the clinic ( terfenadine , terodiline , cisapride ) there is little differentiation between the dog ED50 and the efficacious free plasma concentrations
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in man ( < 10 - fold ) reflecting their limited safety margins .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These data underline the need to maximize the therapeutic ratio with respect to TDP in potential development candidates and the importance of using free drug concentrations in pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic

The main outcome was the number of study participants experiencing akathisia within 60 minutes of administration .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Akathisia was defined as either a spontaneous report of restlessness or agitation or a change of 2 or more in the patient - reported akathisia rating scale and a change
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of at least 1 in the investigator - observed akathisia rating scale .

The intensity of headache and nausea was measured with a 100 - mm visual analog scale .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
One hundred patients were enrolled .
O O O O O O
One study participant was excluded after protocol violation .
O O O O O O O O O
Seventy - three percent ( 73 / 99 ) of the study participants were treated for headache and 70 % ( 70 / 99 ) for nausea .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the bolus group , 26 . 0 % ( 13 / 50 ) had akathisia compared with 32 . 7 % ( 16 / 49 ) in the infusion

The relationship between hippocampal acetylcholine release and cholinergic convulsant sensitivity in withdrawal seizure - prone and withdrawal seizure - resistant selected mouse lines .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
The septo - hippocampal cholinergic pathway has been implicated in epileptogenesis , and genetic factors influence the response to cholinergic agents , but limited data are available on cholinergic involvement
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in alcohol withdrawal severity .
O B O O O
Thus , the relationship between cholinergic activity and responsiveness and alcohol withdrawal was investigated in a genetic animal model of ethanol withdrawal severity .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O
METHODS :
O O
Cholinergic convulsant sensitivity was examined in alcohol - na ve Withdrawal Seizure - Prone ( WSP ) and - Resistant ( WSR ) mice .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Animals were administered nicotine , carbachol , or neostigmine via timed tail vein infusion , and the latencies to onset of tremor and clonus were recorded and converted to threshold
O O O B O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dose .
O O
We also used microdialysis to measure basal and potassium - stimulated acetylcholine ( ACh ) release in the CA1 region of the hippocampus .
O O O O O O O O B O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
Potassium was applied by reverse dialysis twice , separated by 75 min .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hippocampal ACh also was measured during testing for handling - induced convulsions .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Sensitivity to several convulsion endpoints induced by nicotine , carbachol , and neostigmine were significantly greater in WSR versus WSP mice .
O O O O O O O B O B O O B O O O O O O O O O
In microdialysis experiments , the lines did not differ in basal release of ACh , and 50 mM KCl increased ACh output in both lines of mice .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O B O O O O O O O
However , the increase in release of ACh produced by the first application of KCl was 2 - fold higher in WSP versus WSR mice .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
When hippocampal ACh was measured during testing for handling - induced convulsions , extracellular ACh was significantly elevated ( 192 % ) in WSP mice , but was nonsignificantly elevated
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( 59 % ) in WSR mice .
O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
These results suggest that differences in cholinergic activity and postsynaptic sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants may be associated with ethanol withdrawal severity and implicate cholinergic mechanisms in alcohol withdrawal .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O
Specifically , WSP mice may have lower sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants compared with WSR because of postsynaptic receptor desensitization brought on by higher activity of cholinergic neurons .

Prenatal dexamethasone programs hypertension and renal injury in the rat .
O B O O O O O O O O O
Dexamethasone is frequently administered to the developing fetus to accelerate pulmonary development .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The purpose of the present study was to determine if prenatal dexamethasone programmed a progressive increase in blood pressure and renal injury in rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pregnant rats were given either vehicle or 2 daily intraperitoneal injections of dexamethasone ( 0 . 2 mg / kg body weight ) on gestational days 11 and 12 ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
13 and 14 , 15 and 16 , 17 and 18 , or 19 and 20 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Offspring of rats administered dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 gestation had a 20 % reduction in glomerular number compared with control at 6 to 9 months of age (
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
22 527 + / - 509 versus 28 050 + / - 561 , P < 0 . 05 ) , which was comparable to the percent reduction in glomeruli
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
measured at 3 weeks of age .
O O O O O O O
Six - to 9 - month old rats receiving prenatal dexamethasone on days 17 and 18 of gestation
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
had a 17 % reduction in glomeruli ( 23 380 + / - 587 ) compared with control rats ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Male rats that received prenatal dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 , 17 and 18 , and 13 and 14 of gestation had elevated blood pressures at 6 months of
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
age ; the latter group did not have a reduction in glomerular number .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Adult rats given dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 of gestation had more glomeruli with glomerulosclerosis than control rats .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This study shows that prenatal dexamethasone in rats results in a reduction in glomerular number , glomerulosclerosis , and hypertension when administered at specific points during gestation .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hypertension was observed in animals that had a reduction in glomeruli as well as in a group that did not have a reduction in glomerular number , suggesting that a
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
reduction in glomerular number is not the sole cause for the development of hypertension .

The risk of venous thromboembolism in women prescribed cyproterone acetate in combination with ethinyl estradiol : a nested cohort analysis and case - control study .
O O O O O O O O B I O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Cyproterone acetate combined with ethinyl estradiol ( CPA / EE ) is licensed in the UK for the treatment of women with acne and hirsutism and is also a treatment
B I O O B I O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
option for polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) .
O O O O O O O O O
Previous studies have demonstrated an increased risk of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) associated with CPA / EE compared with conventional combined oral contraceptives ( COCs ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O B I O O O O
We believe the results of those studies may have been affected by residual confounding .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Using the General Practice Research Database we conducted a cohort analysis and case - control study nested within a population of women aged between 15 and 39 years with acne
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, hirsutism or PCOS to estimate the risk of VTE associated with CPA / EE .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
RESULTS :
O O
The age - adjusted incidence rate ratio for CPA / EE versus conventional COCs was 2 . 20 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1 . 35 -
O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 . 58 ] .
O O O O O
Using as the reference group women who were not using oral contraception , had no recent pregnancy or menopausal symptoms , the case - control analysis gave an adjusted odds
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ratio ( OR ( adj ) ) of 7 . 44 ( 95 % CI 3 . 67 - 15 . 08 ) for CPA / EE use compared with
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O
an OR ( adj ) of 2 . 58 ( 95 % CI 1 . 60 - 4 . 18 ) for use of conventional COCs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
We have demonstrated an increased risk of VTE associated with the use of CPA / EE in women with acne , hirsutism or PCOS although residual confounding by indication can

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CAB ) .
O O O
Hb , PSA and Testosterone measurements were recorded .
O O O O B O O O O
Patients with stage D2 - 3 disease , abnormal hemoglobin level or renal and liver function tests that were higher than the upper limits were excluded from the study .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The duration of the study was six months .
O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The mean hemoglobin ( Hb ) levels were significantly declined in all patients from baseline of 14 . 2 g / dl to 14 . 0 g / dl ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
13 . 5 g / dl , 13 . 2 g / dl and 12 . 7 g / dl at 1 , 2 , 3 and 6 months post

O O O O O
Severe and clinically evident anemia of Hb
O O O O O O O
< 11 g / dl with clinical symptoms was detected in 6 patients ( 14 . 3 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This CAB - induced anemia was normochromic and normocytic .
O O O O O O O O O O
At six months post - CAB , patients with severe anemia had a Hb mean value of 10 . 2 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

SE ) , whereas the other patients had mild anemia with Hb mean value of 13 . 2 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
0 . 17 ( X + / - SE ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The development of severe anemia at 6 months post - CAB was predictable by the reduction of Hb baseline value of more than 2 . 5 g / dl after
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 months of CAB ( p = 0 . 01 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The development of severe CAB - induced anemia in prostate cancer patients did not correlate with T baseline values ( T < 3 ng / ml versus T > or
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
= 3 ng / ml ) , with age ( < 76 yrs versus > or = 76 yrs ) , and clinical stage ( stage C versus stage D1
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) .

Severe and clinically evident anemia was easily corrected by subcutaneous injections ( 3 times / week for 1 month ) of recombinant erythropoietin ( rHuEPO - beta ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :

Risks of the consumption of beverages containing quinine .
O O O O O O O B O
Although the United States Food and Drug Administration banned its use for nocturnal leg cramps due to lack of safety and efficacy , quinine is widely available in beverages including

O O O B O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
drug atropine sulfate ( 50 . 0 mg / kg BW ) immediately or 30 min after the single SC injection of DFP .
O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The control rats received atropine sulfate , but also saline and olive oil instead of other antidotes and DFP , respectively .
O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
All rats were terminated either 24 h or 3 weeks after the DFP injection .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
The rats treated with DFP - atropine showed severe typical OP - induced toxicity signs .
O O O O B O B O O O B O O O O O
When CPA , diazepam or 2PAM was given immediately after DFP - atropine , these treatments prevented , delayed or shortened the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning .

Differential modulation by estrogen of alpha2 - adrenergic and I1 - imidazoline receptor - mediated hypotension in female rats .
O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
We have recently shown that estrogen negatively modulates the hypotensive effect of clonidine ( mixed alpha2 - / I1 - receptor agonist ) in female rats and implicates the cardiovascular
O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
autonomic control in this interaction .
O O O O O O
The present study investigated whether this effect of estrogen involves interaction with alpha2 -
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
and / or I1 - receptors .
O O O O O O O
Changes evoked by a single intraperitoneal injection of rilmenidine ( 600 microg / kg ) or alpha - methyldopa ( 100 mg / kg ) , selective I1 - and
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
alpha2 - receptor agonists , respectively , in blood pressure , hemodynamic variability , and locomotor activity were assessed in radiotelemetered sham - operated and ovariectomized ( Ovx ) Sprague
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- Dawley female rats with or without 12 - wk estrogen replacement .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Three time domain indexes of hemodynamic variability were employed : the standard deviation of mean arterial pressure as a measure of blood pressure variability and the standard deviation of beat
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- to - beat intervals ( SDRR ) and
O O O O O O O O O
the root mean square of successive differences in R - wave - to - R - wave intervals as measures of heart rate variability .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In sham - operated rats , rilmenidine or alpha - methyldopa elicited similar hypotension that lasted at least 5 h and was associated with reductions in standard deviation of mean
O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
arterial pressure .
O O O
SDRR was reduced only by alpha - methyldopa .
O O O O O B I I O
Ovx significantly enhanced the hypotensive response to alpha - methyldopa , in contrast to no effect on rilmenidine hypotension .
O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B O O
The enhanced alpha - methyldopa hypotension in Ovx rats was paralleled with further reduction in SDRR and a reduced locomotor activity .
O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Estrogen replacement ( 17beta - estradiol subcutaneous pellet , 14 . 2 microg / day , 12 wk ) of Ovx rats restored the hemodynamic and locomotor effects of
O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
alpha - methyldopa to sham - operated levels .
B I I O O O O O O
These findings suggest that estrogen downregulates alpha2 - but not I1 - receptor - mediated hypotension and highlight a role for the cardiac autonomic control in alpha - methyldopa -

Ceftriaxone - associated biliary pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients .
B O O O O O O O O O
It is well known that ceftriaxone leads to pseudolithiasis in some patients .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Clinical and experimental studies also suggest that situations causing gallbladder dysfunction , such as fasting , may have a role for the development of pseudolithiasis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this study , we prospectively evaluated the incidence and clinical importance of pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients receiving ceftriaxone treatment , who often had to fast in the post

O O O O
Fifty children who were given ceftriaxone were evaluated by serial abdominal sonograms .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Of those , 13 ( 26 % ) developed biliary pathology .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Comparison of the patients with or without pseudolithiasis revealed no significant difference with respect to age , sex , duration of the treatment and starvation variables .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After cessation of the treatment , pseudolithiasis resolved spontaneously within a short period .

Evaluation of the anticocaine monoclonal antibody GNC92H2 as an immunotherapy for cocaine overdose .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The illicit use of cocaine continues in epidemic proportions and treatment for cocaine overdose remains elusive .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Current protein - based technology offers a new therapeutic venue by which antibodies bind the drug in the blood stream , inactivating its toxic effects .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The therapeutic potential of the anticocaine antibody GNC92H2 was examined using a model of cocaine overdose .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Swiss albino mice prepared with intrajugular catheters were tested in photocell cages after administration of 93 mg / kg ( LD50 ) of cocaine and GNC92H2 infusions ranging from 30
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O
to 190 mg / kg .
O O O O O O
GNC92H2 was delivered 30 min before , concomitantly or 3 min after cocaine treatment .
B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Significant blockade of cocaine toxicity was observed with the higher dose of GNC92H2 ( 190 mg / kg ) , where premorbid behaviors were reduced up to 40 % ,
O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seizures up to 77 % and death by 72 % .

The effects of short - term raloxifene therapy on fibrinolysis markers : TAFI , tPA , and PAI - 1 .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND : Markers of fibrinolysis , thrombin - activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor ( TAFI ) , tissue - type plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , and plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( PAI - 1 ) levels were studied for the evaluation of short - term effects of raloxifene administration in postmenopausal women .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Thirty - nine postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis were included in this prospective , controlled clinical study .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Twenty - five women were given raloxifene hydrochloride ( 60 mg / day ) plus calcium ( 500 mg / day ) .
O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Age - matched controls ( n = 14 ) were given only calcium .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Plasma TAFI , tPA , and PAI - 1
O O O O O O O O O
antigen levels were measured at baseline and after 3 months of treatment by commercially available ELISA kits .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Variations of individuals were assessed by Wilcoxon 's test .
O O O O O O O O O O
Relationship between those markers and demographic characteristics were investigated .
O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Three months of raloxifene treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the plasma TAFI antigen concentrations ( 16 % change , P < 0 . 01 ) , and
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a significant increase in tPA antigen concentrations ( 25 % change , P < 0 . 05 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A significant correlation was found between baseline TAFI antigen concentrations and the duration of amenorrhea ( P < 0 . 05 ; r = 0 . 33 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
We suggest that the increased risk of venous thromboembolism due to raloxifene treatment may be related to increased tPA levels , but not TAFI levels .

Ketoconazole induced torsades de pointes without concomitant use of QT interval - prolonging drug .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ketoconazole is not known to be proarrhythmic without concomitant use of QT interval - prolonging drugs .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We report a woman with coronary artery disease who developed a markedly prolonged QT interval and torsades de pointes ( TdP ) after taking ketoconazole for treatment of fungal infection
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O

Her QT interval returned to normal upon withdrawal of ketoconazole .
O O O O O O O O O B O
Genetic study did not find any mutation in her genes that encode cardiac IKr channel proteins .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We postulate that by virtue of its direct blocking action on IKr , ketoconazole alone may prolong QT interval and induce TdP .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
This calls for attention when ketoconazole is administered to patients with risk factors for acquired long QT syndrome .

Pharmacological evidence for the potential of Daucus carota in the management of cognitive dysfunctions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of Daucus carota seeds on cognitive functions , total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity in mice .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
The ethanolic extract of Daucus carota seeds ( DCE ) was administered orally in three doses ( 100 , 200 , 400 mg / kg ) for seven successive days
O O B I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to different groups of young and aged mice .
O O O O O O O O O
Elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Diazepam - , scopolamine - and ageing - induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models .
B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DCE ( 200 , 400 mg / kg , p . o . ) showed significant improvement in memory scores of young and aged mice .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The extent of memory improvement evoked by DCE was 23 % at the dose of 200 mg / kg and 35 % at the dose of 400 mg / kg
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in young mice using elevated plus maze .
O O O O O O O O
Similarly , significant improvements in memory scores were observed using passive avoidance apparatus and aged mice .

O O O O O O
Daucus carota extract ( 200 , 400 mg / kg , p . o . )
B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
reduced significantly the brain acetylcholinesterase activity and cholesterol levels in young and aged mice .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The extent of inhibition of brain cholinesterase activity evoked by DCE at the dose of 400 mg / kg was 22 % in young and 19 % in aged mice

High - dose testosterone is associated with atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women .
O O O B O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVES :
O O
To study the long - term effects of androgen treatment on atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
In a population - based study in 513 naturally postmenopausal women aged 54 - 67 years , we studied the association between self - reported intramuscularly administered high - dose
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
estrogen - testosterone therapy ( estradiol - and testosterone esters ) and aortic atherosclerosis .
B O B O O B I I I I O O O O O
Aortic atherosclerosis was diagnosed by radiographic detection of calcified deposits in the abdominal aorta , which have been shown to reflect intima atherosclerosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hormone therapy users were compared with never users .
O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Intramuscular hormone therapy use for 1 year or longer was reported by 25 women .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In almost half of these women severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present ( n = 11 ) , while in women without hormone use severe atherosclerosis of the aorta
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was present in less than 20 % ( OR 3 . 1 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 1 - 8 . 5 , adjusted for age , years
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

O O O O O O O O O O O
The association remained after additional adjustment for diabetes , cholesterol level , systolic blood pressure , or alcohol use .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O
No association was found for hormone use less than 1 year .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :

Sirolimus - associated proteinuria and renal dysfunction .
B O O O O O O O
Sirolimus is a novel immunosuppressant with potent antiproliferative actions through its ability to inhibit the raptor - containing mammalian target of rapamycin protein kinase .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Sirolimus represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Its role in the therapy of glomerulonephritis , autoimmunity , cystic renal diseases and renal cancer is under investigation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because sirolimus does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors , it has been designated a ' non - nephrotoxic drug ' .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , clinical reports suggest that , under some circumstances , sirolimus is associated with proteinuria and acute renal dysfunction .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
A common risk factor appears to be presence of pre - existing chronic renal damage .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mechanisms of sirolimus - associated proteinuria are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It has also been suggested that sirolimus directly causes increased glomerular permeability / injury , but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The acute renal dysfunction associated with sirolimus ( such as in delayed graft function ) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival / repair processes
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Although these adverse effects occur in some patients , their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney , the use of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
sirolimus in appropriate patient populations , close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function , use of angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I O O O O O O
withdrawal if needed .
O O O O
Further long - term analysis of renal allograft studies using sirolimus as de novo immunosuppression along with clinical and laboratory studies will refine these issues in the future .

Progressive myopathy with up - regulation of MHC -
O O O O O O O O O
I associated with statin therapy .
O O O B O O
Statins can cause a necrotizing myopathy and hyperCKaemia which is reversible on cessation of the drug .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What is less well known is a phenomenon whereby statins may induce a myopathy , which persists or may progress after stopping the drug .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We investigated the muscle pathology in 8 such cases .
O O O O O O O O O O
All had myofibre necrosis but only 3 had an inflammatory infiltrate .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
In all cases there was diffuse or multifocal up - regulation of MHC - I expression even in non - necrotic fibres .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Progressive improvement occurred in 7 cases after commencement of prednisolone and methotrexate , and in one case spontaneously .
O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O
These observations suggest that statins may initiate an immune - mediated myopathy that persists after withdrawal of the drug and responds to immunosuppressive therapy .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mechanism of this myopathy is uncertain but may involve the induction by statins of an endoplasmic reticulum stress response with associated up - regulation of MHC - I expression
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and antigen presentation by muscle fibres .

Direct inhibition of cardiac hyperpolarization - activated cyclic nucleotide - gated pacemaker channels by clonidine .
O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B O
BACKGROUND : Inhibition of cardiac sympathetic tone represents an important strategy for treatment of cardiovascular disease , including arrhythmia , coronary heart disease , and chronic heart failure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Activation of presynaptic alpha2 - adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the antisympathetic drug clonidine ; however , other target proteins have been postulated to contribute
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
to the in vivo actions of clonidine .
O O O O O O B O
METHODS AND RESULTS :
O O O O
To test whether clonidine elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha2 - adrenoceptors , we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all 3 alpha2 - adrenoceptor subtypes ( alpha2ABC
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- / - ) .
O O O O O
Alpha2ABC - / - mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of clonidine ; however , clonidine significantly lowered heart rate in alpha2ABC - / - mice
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
by up to 150 bpm .
O O O O O O
Clonidine - induced bradycardia in conscious alpha2ABC - / - mice was 32 . 3 % ( 10 microg / kg ) and 26 . 6 % ( 100 microg
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
/ kg ) of the effect in wild - type mice .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
A similar bradycardic effect of clonidine was observed in isolated spontaneously beating right atria from alpha2ABC - knockout and wild - type mice .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clonidine inhibited the native pacemaker current ( I ( f ) ) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells and the I ( f ) - generating hyperpolarization - activated
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cyclic nucleotide - gated ( HCN ) 2 and HCN4 channels in transfected HEK293 cells .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As a consequence of blocking I ( f ) , clonidine reduced the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from wild
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- type and alpha2ABC - knockout mice .
O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Direct inhibition of cardiac HCN pacemaker channels contributes to the bradycardic effects of clonidine gene - targeted mice in vivo , and thus , clonidine - like drugs represent novel
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
structures for future HCN channel inhibitors .

Influence of smoking on developing cochlea .
O O B O O O O
Does smoking during pregnancy affect the amplitudes of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in newborns ?
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE : Maternal tobacco smoking has negative effects on fetal growth .
O O O O B O O O O O O O
The influence of smoking during pregnancy on the developing cochlea has not been estimated , although smoking has been positively associated with hearing loss in adults .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
The objective of this study was to determine the effects of maternal smoking on transient evoked otoacoustic emissions ( TEOAEs ) of healthy neonates .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
This study was undertaken as part of neonatal screening for hearing impairment and involved both ears of 200 newborns .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Newborns whose mothers reported smoking during pregnancy ( n = 200 ears ) were compared to a control group of newborns ( n = 200 ears ) , whose mothers
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
were non - smokers .
O O O O O
Exposure to tobacco was characterized as low ( < 5 cigarettes per day , n = 88 ears ) , moderate ( 5 < or = cigarettes per day <
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
10 , n = 76 ) or high ( > or = 10 cigarettes per day , n = 36 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
In exposed neonates , TEOAEs mean response ( across frequency ) and mean amplitude at 4000Hz was significantly lower than in non - exposed neonates .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Comparisons between exposed newborns ' subgroups revealed no significant differences .
O O O O O O O O O O O
However , by comparing each subgroup to control group , we found statistically significant decreases of TEOAEs amplitudes at 4000Hz for all three groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mean TEOAEs responses of highly exposed newborns were also significantly lower in comparison to our control group .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
In utero , exposure to tobacco smoking seems to have a small impact on outer hair cells .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
These effects seem to be equally true for all exposed newborns , regardless of the degree of exposure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Further studies are needed in order to establish a potential negative effect of maternal smoking on the neonate 's hearing acuity .

Neuroinflammation and behavioral abnormalities after neonatal terbutaline treatment in rats : implications for autism .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder presenting before 3 years of age with deficits in communication and social skills and repetitive behaviors .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition to genetic influences , recent studies suggest that prenatal drug or chemical exposures are risk factors for autism .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Terbutaline , a beta2 - adrenoceptor agonist used to arrest preterm labor , has been associated with increased concordance for autism in dizygotic twins .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We studied the effects of terbutaline on microglial activation in different brain regions and behavioral outcomes in developing rats .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Newborn rats were given terbutaline ( 10 mg / kg ) daily on postnatal days ( PN ) 2 to 5 or PN 11 to 14 and examined 24 h
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after the last dose and at PN 30 .
O O O O O O O O O
Immunohistochemical studies showed that administration of terbutaline on PN 2 to 5 produced a robust increase in microglial activation on PN 30 in the cerebral cortex , as well as
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in cerebellar and cerebrocortical white matter .
O O O O O O O
None of these effects occurred in animals given terbutaline on PN 11 to 14 .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O

Norepinephrine signaling through beta - adrenergic receptors is critical for expression of cocaine - induced anxiety .
B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Cocaine is a widely abused psychostimulant that has both rewarding and aversive properties .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While the mechanisms underlying cocaine 's rewarding effects have been studied extensively , less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by cocaine , such as anxiety
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
.
O
METHODS :
O O
In this study , we evaluated the performance of dopamine beta - hydroxylase knockout ( Dbh - / - ) mice , which lack norepinephrine ( NE ) , in
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O
the elevated plus maze ( EPM ) to examine the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to cocaine - induced anxiety .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
We found that cocaine dose - dependently increased anxiety - like behavior in control ( Dbh + / -
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) mice , as measured by a decrease in open arm exploration .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Dbh - / - mice had normal baseline performance in the EPM but were completely resistant to the anxiogenic effects of cocaine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Cocaine - induced anxiety was also attenuated in Dbh + / -
B O O O O O O O O O O O
mice following administration of disulfiram , a dopamine beta - hydroxylase ( DBH ) inhibitor .
O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O
In experiments using specific adrenergic antagonists , we found that pretreatment with the beta - adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blocked cocaine - induced anxiety - like behavior in Dbh +
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O

O O
and wild - type C57BL6 / J mice , while the alpha ( 1 ) antagonist prazosin and the alpha ( 2 ) antagonist yohimbine had no effect .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :

ECG changes and adverse events analysis .
O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To examine the safety and tolerability of clonidine used alone or with methylphenidate in children with attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHOD :
O O
In a 16 - week multicenter , double - blind trial , 122 children with ADHD were randomly assigned to clonidine ( n = 31 ) , methylphenidate ( n
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O
= 29 ) , clonidine and methylphenidate ( n = 32 ) , or placebo ( n = 30 ) .
O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Doses were flexibly titrated up to 0 . 6 mg / day for clonidine and 60 mg / day for methylphenidate ( both with divided dosing ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Groups were compared regarding adverse events and changes from baseline to week 16 in electrocardiograms and vital signs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
There were more incidents of bradycardia in subjects treated with clonidine compared with those not treated with clonidine ( 17 . 5 % versus 3 . 4 % ; p
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
= . 02 ) , but no other significant group differences regarding electrocardiogram and other cardiovascular outcomes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There were no suggestions of interactions between clonidine and methylphenidate regarding cardiovascular outcomes .
O O O O O O O B O B O O O O
Moderate or severe adverse events were more common in subjects on clonidine ( 79 . 4 % versus 49 . 2 % ; p = . 0006 ) but not
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
associated with higher rates of early study withdrawal .
O O O O O O O O O
Drowsiness was common on clonidine , but generally resolved by 6 to 8 weeks .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Clonidine , used alone or with methylphenidate , appears safe and well tolerated in childhood ADHD .
B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Physicians prescribing clonidine should monitor for bradycardia and advise patients about the high likelihood of initial drowsiness .

Thalidomide has limited single - agent activity in relapsed or refractory indolent non - Hodgkin lymphomas : a phase II trial of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with demonstrated activity in multiple myeloma , mantle cell lymphoma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Its activity is believed to be due modulation of the tumour milieu , including downregulation of angiogenesis and inflammatory cytokines .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Between July 2001 and April 2004 , 24 patients with relapsed / refractory indolent lymphomas received thalidomide 200 mg daily with escalation by 100 mg daily every 1 - 2

The glycine transporter - 1 inhibitor SSR103800 displays a selective and specific antipsychotic - like profile in normal and transgenic mice .
O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Schizophrenia has been initially associated with dysfunction in dopamine neurotransmission .
O O O O O O O O B O O
However , the observation that antagonists of the glutamate N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor produce schizophrenic - like symptoms in humans has led to
O O O O O O O O B B I I I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
the idea of a dysfunctioning of the glutamatergic system via its NMDA receptor .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
As a result , there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via a modulation
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of the NMDA receptor .
O O B O O
Among them are glycine transporter - 1
O O O B O O O
( GlyT1 ) inhibitors such as SSR103800 , which indirectly enhance NMDA receptor function by increasing the glycine ( a co - agonist for the NMDA receptor ) levels in
O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O
the synapse .
O O O
This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic - like properties of SSR103800 , with a particular focus on models of hyperactivity , involving either drug challenge ( ie ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
amphetamine and MK - 801 ) or transgenic mice ( ie , NMDA Nr1 ( neo - / - ) and DAT ( - / - ) ) .
B O B I I O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Results showed that SSR103800 ( 10 - 30 mg / kg p . o . )
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
blocked hyperactivity induced by the non - competitive NMDA receptor antagonist , MK - 801 and partially reversed spontaneous hyperactivity of NMDA Nr1 ( neo - / - ) mice
O O O O O O O O B O O O B I I O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
.
O
In contrast , SSR103800 failed to affect hyperactivity induced by amphetamine or naturally observed in dopamine transporter ( DAT ( - / - ) ) knockout mice
O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
( 10 - 30 mg / kg p . o . ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Importantly , both classical ( haloperidol ) and atypical ( olanzapine , clozapine and aripiprazole ) antipsychotics were effective in all these models of hyperactivity .
O O O O O B O O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O
However , unlike these latter , SSR103800 did not produce catalepsy ( retention on the bar test ) up to 30 mg / kg p . o .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Together these findings show that the GlyT1 inhibitor , SSR103800 , produces antipsychotic - like effects , which differ from those observed with compounds primarily targeting the dopaminergic system ,
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and has a reduced side - effect potential as compared with these latter drugs .

A novel , multiple symptom model of obsessive - compulsive - like behaviors in animals .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Current animal models of obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) typically involve acute , drug - induced symptom provocation or a genetic association with stereotypies or anxiety .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
None of these current models demonstrate multiple OCD - like behaviors .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Neonatal rats were treated with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine or vehicle between days 9 and 16 twice daily and behaviorally tested in adulthood .
O O O O O O O B B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Clomipramine exposure in immature rats produced significant behavioral and biochemical changes that include enhanced anxiety ( elevated plus maze and marble burying ) , behavioral inflexibility ( perseveration in the
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
spontaneous alternation task and impaired reversal learning ) , working memory impairment ( e . g . , win - shift paradigm ) , hoarding , and corticostriatal dysfunction .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Dopamine D2 receptors were elevated in the striatum , whereas serotonin 2C , but not serotonin 1A , receptors were elevated in the orbital frontal cortex .
B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
This is the first demonstration of multiple symptoms consistent with an OCD - like profile in animals .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Moreover , these behaviors are accompanied by biochemical changes in brain regions previously identified as relevant to OCD .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This novel model of OCD demonstrates that drug exposure during a sensitive period can program disease - like systems permanently , which could have implications for current and future therapeutic

strategies for this and other psychiatric disorders .

A case is reported of the hemolytic uremic syndrome ( HUS ) in a woman taking oral contraceptives .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
She was treated with heparin , dipyridamole and hemodialysis ; and after more than three months , her urinary output rose above 500 ml ; and six months after the

This case emphasizes the possibility that HUS in adults is not invariably irreversible and that , despite prolonged oliguria , recovery of renal function can be obtained .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , in adult patients affected by HUS , dialysis should not be discontinued prematurely ; moreover , bilateral nephrectomy , for treatment of severe hypertension and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia

Eight glaucomatous patients chronically treated with timolol 0 . 5 % / 12h , suffering from depression diagnosed through DMS - III - R criteria , were included in the
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
study .

During the six - month follow up , depression was quantified through the Beck and Zung - Conde scales every two months .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In a double blind cross - over study with control group , the patients under timolol treatment presented higher depression values measured through the Beck and the Zung - Conde
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
scales ( p < 0 . 001 vs control ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that betaxolol could be less of a depression - inducer than timolol in predisposed patients .

Long - term follow - up of ifosfamide renal toxicity in children treated for malignant mesenchymal tumors : an International Society of Pediatric Oncology report .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The renal function of 74 children with malignant mesenchymal tumors in complete remission and who have received the same ifosfamide chemotherapy protocol ( International Society of Pediatric Oncology Malignant Mesenchymal
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Tumor Study 84 [ SIOP MMT 84 ] ) were studied 1 year after the completion of treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Total cumulative doses were 36 or 60 g / m2 of ifosfamide ( six or 10 cycles of ifosfamide , vincristine , and dactinomycin [ IVA ] ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I I I I O B O O O
None of them had received cisplatin chemotherapy .
O O O O O B O O
Ages ranged from 4 months to 17 years ; 58 patients were males and 42 females .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The most common primary tumor site was the head and neck .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Renal function was investigated by measuring plasma and urinary electrolytes , glucosuria , proteinuria , aminoaciduria , urinary pH , osmolarity , creatinine clearance , phosphate tubular reabsorption , beta
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O
2 microglobulinuria , and lysozymuria .
O O O O O O
Fifty - eight patients ( 78 % ) had normal renal tests , whereas 16 patients ( 22 % ) had renal abnormalities .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two subsets of patients were identified from this latter group : the first included four patients ( 5 % of the total population ) who developed major toxicity resulting in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fanconi 's syndrome ( TDFS ) ; and the second group included five patients with elevated beta 2 microglobulinuria and low phosphate reabsorption .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
The remaining seven patients had isolated beta 2 microglobulinuria .
O O O O O O O O O O
Severe toxicity was correlated with the higher cumulative dose of 60 g / m2 of ifosfamide , a younger age ( less than 2 1 / 2 years old )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, and a predominance of vesicoprostatic tumor involvement .
O O O O O O O O O
This low percentage ( 5 % ) of TDFS must be evaluated with respect to the efficacy of ifosfamide in the treatment of mesenchymal tumors in children .

Evidence for an involvement of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine - induced hyperactivity in rats .
O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O
Previous studies have suggested that repeated exposure of rats to the drug or to the experimental environment is necessary to observe nicotine - induced locomotor stimulation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
In the present study the role of habituation to the experimental environment on the stimulant effect of nicotine in rats was examined .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
In addition , the role of dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine - induced locomotor stimulation was investigated by examining the effects of selective D1 and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists on
O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
activity induced by nicotine .
O O O B O
Locomotor activity was assessed in male Sprague - Dawley rats tested in photocell cages .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nicotine ( 1 . 0 mg / kg ) caused a significant increase in locomotor activity in rats that were habituated to the test environment , but had only a
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
weak and delayed stimulant action in rats that were unfamiliar with the test environment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The stimulant action of nicotine was blocked by the central nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine but not by the peripheral nicotinic blocker hexamethonium , indicating that the response is probably mediated by
O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
central nicotinic receptors .
O O O O
Nicotine - induced hyperactivity was blocked by the selective D1 antagonist SCH 23390 , the selective D2 antagonist raclopride and the D1 / D2 antagonist fluphenazine .
B O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B O O O O O O B O
Pretreatment with the D2 agonist PHNO enhanced nicotine - induced hyperactivity , whereas the D1 agonist SKF 38393 had no effect .
O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
The results indicate that acute nicotine injection induces a pronounced hyperactivity in rats habituated to the test environment .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The effect appears to be mediated by central nicotine receptors , possibly located on dopaminergic neurons , and also requires the activation of both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors .

Neuropsychiatric side effects after the use of mefloquine .
O O O O O O O B O
This study describes neuropsychiatric side effects in patients after treatment with mefloquine .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Reactions consisted mainly of seizures , acute psychoses , anxiety neurosis , and major disturbances of sleep - wake rhythm .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Side effects occurred after both therapeutic and prophylactic intake and were graded from moderate to severe .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In a risk analysis of neuropsychiatric side effects in Germany , it is estimated that one of 8 , 000 mefloquine users suffers from such reactions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The incidence calculation revealed that one of 215 therapeutic users had reactions , compared with one of 13 , 000 in the prophylaxis group , making the risk of neuropsychiatric
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
reactions after mefloquine treatment 60 times higher than after prophylaxis .
O O B O O O O O O O O
Therefore , certain limitations for malaria prophylaxis and treatment with mefloquine are recommended .

Reduction in injection pain using buffered lidocaine as a local anesthetic before cardiac catheterization .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Previous reports have suggested that pain associated with the injection of lidocaine is related to the acidic pH of the solution .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
To determine if the addition of a buffering solution to adjust the pH of lidocaine into the physiologic range would reduce pain during injection , we performed a blinded randomized
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
study in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization .
O O O O O O O
Twenty patients were asked to quantify the severity of pain after receiving standard lidocaine in one femoral area and buffered lidocaine in the opposite femoral area .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The mean pain score for buffered lidocaine was significantly lower than the mean score for standard lidocaine ( 2 . 7 + / -

O O O O O O O O O O O
The pH adjustment of standard lidocaine can be accomplished easily in the catheterization laboratory before injection and results in a reduction of the pain occurring during the infiltration of tissues

Randomized , double - blind trial of mazindol in Duchenne dystrophy .
O O O O O O O B O O O O
There is evidence that growth hormone may be related to the progression of weakness in Duchenne dystrophy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We conducted a 12 - month controlled trial of mazindol , a putative growth hormone secretion inhibitor , in 83 boys with Duchenne dystrophy .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Muscle strength , contractures , functional ability and pulmonary function were tested at baseline , and 6 and 12 months after treatment with mazindol ( 3 mg / d )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
or placebo .
O O O
The study was designed to have a power of greater than 0 . 90 to detect a slowing to 25 % of the expected rate of progression of weakness at
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
P less than 0 . 05 .
O O O O O O O
Mazindol did not benefit strength at any point in the study .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
Side effects attributable to mazindol included decreased appetite ( 36 % ) , dry mouth ( 10 % ) , behavioral change ( 22 % ) , and gastrointestinal symptoms
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( 18 % ) ; mazindol dosage was reduced in 43 % of patients .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
The effect of mazindol on GH secretion was estimated indirectly by comparing the postabsorptive IGF - I levels obtained following 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 months in
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mazindol treated to those in the placebo groups .

Although mazindol - treated patients gained less weight and height than placebo - treated patients , no significant effect on IGF - I levels was observed .

Pentoxifylline ( Trental ) does not inhibit dipyridamole - induced coronary hyperemia : implications for dipyridamole - thallium - 201 myocardial imaging .
B O B O O O O B O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
Dipyridamole - thallium - 201 imaging is often performed in patients unable to exercise because of peripheral vascular disease .
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many of these patients are taking pentoxifylline ( Trental ) , a methylxanthine derivative which may improve intermittent claudication .
O O O O O O B O B O O O B O O O O O O O
Whether pentoxifylline inhibits dipyridamole - induced coronary hyperemia like other methylxanthines such as theophylline and should be stopped prior to dipyridamole - thallium - 201 imaging is unknown .
O B O B O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O
Therefore , we studied the hyperemic response to dipyridamole in seven open - chest anesthetized dogs after pretreatment with either pentoxifylline ( 0 , 7 . 5 , or 15
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
mg / kg i . v . ) or theophylline ( 3 mg / kg i . v . ) .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Baseline circumflex coronary blood flows did not differ significantly among treatment groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Dipyridamole significantly increased coronary blood flow before and after 7 . 5 or 15 mm / kg i . v .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pentoxifylline ( p less than 0 . 002 ) .
B O O O O O O O O O
Neither dose of pentoxifylline significantly decreased the dipyridamole - induced hyperemia , while peak coronary blood flow was significantly lower after theophylline ( p less than 0 . 01 )
O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
.

We conclude that pentoxyifylline does not inhibit dipyridamole - induced coronary hyperemia even at high doses .

Cause of death among patients with Parkinson 's disease : a rare mortality due to cerebral haemorrhage .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Causes of death , with special reference to cerebral haemorrhage , among 240 patients with pathologically verified Parkinson 's disease were investigated using the Annuals of the Pathological Autopsy Cases
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in Japan from 1981 to 1985 .
O O O O O O O
The leading causes of death were pneumonia and bronchitis ( 44 . 1 % ) , malignant neoplasms ( 11 . 6 % ) , heart diseases ( 4 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 % ) , cerebral infarction ( 3 . 7 % ) and septicaemia ( 3 . 3 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cerebral haemorrhage was the 11th most frequent cause of death , accounting for only 0 . 8 % of deaths among the patients , whereas it was the 5th most
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
common cause of death among the Japanese general population in 1985 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The low incidence of cerebral haemorrhage as a cause of death in patients with Parkinson 's disease may reflect the hypotensive effect of levodopa and a hypotensive mechanism due to
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
reduced noradrenaline levels in the parkinsonian brain .

Tolerance and antiviral effect of ribavirin in patients with Argentine hemorrhagic fever .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Tolerance and antiviral effect of ribavirin was studied in 6 patients with Argentine hemorrhagic fever ( AHF ) of more than 8 days of evolution .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Administration of ribavirin resulted in a neutralization of viremia and a drop of endogenous interferon titers .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The average time of death was delayed .
O O O O O O O O
A reversible anemia was the only adverse effect observed .
O O O O O O O O O O
From these results , we conclude that ribavirin has an antiviral effect in advanced cases of AHF , and that anemia , the only secondary reaction observed , can be

easily managed .

Angina and ischemic electrocardiographic changes occurred after administration of oral dipyridamole in four patients awaiting urgent myocardial revascularization procedures .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
To our knowledge , this has not previously been reported as a side effect of preoperative dipyridamole therapy , although dipyridamole - induced myocardial ischemia has been demonstrated to occur
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O
in animals and humans with coronary artery disease .
O O O O O O O O O
Epicardial coronary collateral vessels were demonstrated in all four patients ; a coronary """" steal """" phenomenon may be the mechanism of the dipyridamole - induced ischemia observed .

Inhibition of immunoreactive corticotropin - releasing factor secretion into the hypophysial - portal circulation by delayed glucocorticoid feedback .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nitroprusside - induced hypotension evokes
B O O O O
ACTH secretion which is primarily mediated by enhanced secretion of immunoreactive corticotropin - releasing factor ( irCRF ) into the hypophysial - portal circulation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Portal plasma concentrations of neither arginine vasopressin nor oxytocin are significantly altered in this paradigm .
O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O
Application of a delayed feedback signal , in the form of a 2 - h systemic corticosterone infusion in urethane - anesthetized rats with pharmacological blockade of glucocorticoid synthesis ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O
is without effect on the resting secretion of arginine vasopressin and oxytocin at any corticosterone feedback dose tested .
O O O O O O O O B I O B O O B O O O O
Resting irCRF levels are suppressed only at the highest corticosterone infusion rate , which resulted in systemic corticosterone levels of 40 micrograms / dl .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Suppression of irCRF secretion in response to nitroprusside - induced hypotension is observed and occurs at a plasma corticosterone level between 8 - 12 micrograms / dl .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
These studies provide further evidence for a strong central component of the delayed feedback process which is mediated by modulation of irCRF release .

Noradrenergic involvement in catalepsy induced by delta 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol .
O O O O O O B I I I O
In order to elucidate the role of the catecholaminergic system in the cataleptogenic effect of delta 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , the effect of pretreatment with
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O O O O O O O
6 - hydroxydopamine ( 6 - OHDA ) or with desipramine and 6 - OHDA and lesions of the locus coeruleus were investigated in rats .
B I I O B I I O O O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
The cataleptogenic effect of THC was significantly reduced in rats treated with 6 - OHDA and in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus but not in rats treated with
O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
desipramine and 6 - OHDA , as compared with control rats .
B O B I I O O O O O O O
On the contrary , the cataleptogenic effect of haloperidol was significantly reduced in rats treated with desipramine and 6 - OHDA but not in rats treated with
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O O
6 - OHDA or in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus .
B I I O O O O O O O O O O
These results indicate that noradrenergic neurons have an important role in the manifestation of catalepsy induced by THC , whereas dopaminergic neurons are important in catalepsy induced by haloperidol .

O O O
Following instrumentation , halothane was discontinued and alfentanil ( 125 mu / kg ) administered iv during emergence from halothane anesthesia .
O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
In the five rats that developed somatic rigidity , ICP and CVP increased significantly above baseline ( delta ICP 7 . 5 + / -

These variables returned to baseline when rigidity was abolished with metocurine .
O O O O O O O O O O B O
In five rats that did not become rigid , ICP and CVP did not change following alfentanil .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
These observations suggest that rigidity should be prevented when alfentanil , and , presumably , other opiates , are used in the anesthetic management of patients with ICP problems .

Survival for patients with advanced head and neck carcinoma and esophageal carcinoma is poor with radiotherapy and / or surgery .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Obviously , there is a need for effective chemotherapy .
O O O O O O O O O O
In the present study , cis - platin ( 80 - 120 mg / m2BSA ) and 5 - FU ( 1000 mg / m2BSA daily as a continuous infusion
O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
during 5 days ) were given to 76 patients before radiotherapy and surgery .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The aim of the study was to clarify the incidence and severity of adverse cardiac effects to this treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Before treatment all patients had a cardiac evaluation and during treatment serial ECG recordings were performed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the pre - treatment evaluation , signs of cardiovascular disease were found in 33 patients ( 43 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
During treatment , adverse cardiac effects were observed in 14 patients ( 18 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mean age of these patients was the same as for the entire group , 64 years .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The incidence of cardiotoxicity was not higher in patients with signs of cardiovascular disease than in those without in the pre - treatment evaluation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The most common signs of cardiotoxicity were chest pain , ST - T wave changes and atrial fibrillation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This was followed by ventricular fibrillation in one patient and sudden death in another .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is concluded that patients on 5 - FU treatment should be under close supervision and that the treatment should be discontinued if chest pain or tachyarrhythmia is observed .

Serial studies of auditory neurotoxicity in patients receiving deferoxamine therapy .
O O O O O O O O B O O
Visual and auditory neurotoxicity was previously documented in 42 of 89 patients with transfusion - dependent anemia who were receiving iron chelation therapy with daily subcutaneous deferoxamine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O
Twenty - two patients in the affected group had abnormal audiograms with deficits mostly in the high frequency range of 4 , 000 to 8 , 000 Hz and in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hearing threshold levels of 30 to 100 decibels .
O O O O O O O O O O
When deferoxamine therapy was discontinued and serial studies were performed , audiograms in seven cases reverted to normal or near normal within two to three weeks , and nine of
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
13 patients with symptoms became asymptomatic .
O O O O O O O
Audiograms from 15 patients remained abnormal and four patients required hearing aids because of permanent disability .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving deferoxamine doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg / kg per dose , therapy was restarted with lower doses
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, usually 50 mg / kg per dose or less depending on the degree of auditory abnormality , and with the exception of two cases no further toxicity was demonstrated
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Auditory deterioration and improvement , demonstrated serially in individual patients receiving and not receiving deferoxamine , respectively , provided convincing evidence for a cause - and - effect relation between
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
deferoxamine administration and ototoxicity .
B O O O O
Based on these data , a plan of management was developed that allows effective yet safe administration of deferoxamine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
A dose of 50 mg / kg is recommended in those without audiogram abnormalities .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
With mild toxicity , a reduction to 30 or 40 mg / kg per dose should result in a reversal of the abnormal results to normal within four weeks .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Moderate abnormalities require a reduction of deferoxamine to 25 mg / kg per dose with careful monitoring .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
In those with symptoms of hearing loss , the drug should be stopped for four weeks , and when the audiogram is stable or improved , therapy should be restarted
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at 10 to 25 mg / kg per dose .
O O O O O O O O O O
Serial audiograms should be performed every six months in those without problems and more frequently in young patients with normal serum ferritin values and in those with auditory dysfunction .

The correlation between neurotoxic esterase inhibition and mipafox - induced neuropathic damage in rats .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The correlation between neuropathic damage and inhibition of neurotoxic esterase or neuropathy target enzyme ( NTE ) was examined in rats acutely exposed to Mipafox (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
N , N' - diisopropylphosphorodiamidofluoridate ) , a neurotoxic organophosphate .
B I I I I O O O O B O
Brain and spinal cord NTE activities were measured in Long - Evans male rats 1 hr post - exposure to various dosages of Mipafox ( ip , 1 - 15
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
mg / kg ) .
O O O O O
These data were correlated with histologically scored cervical cord damage in a separate group of similarly dosed rats sampled 14 - 21 days post - exposure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Those dosages ( greater than or equal to 10 mg / kg ) that inhibited mean NTE activity in the spinal cord greater than or equal to 73 % and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
brain greater than or equal to 67 % of control values produced severe ( greater than or equal to 3 ) cervical cord pathology in 85 % of the rats
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
In contrast , dosages of Mipafox ( less than or equal to 5 mg / kg ) which inhibited mean NTE activity in spinal cord less than or equal to
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
61 % and brain less than or equal to 60 % produced this degree of cord damage in only 9 % of the animals .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These data indicate that a critical percentage of NTE inhibition in brain and spinal cord sampled shortly after Mipafox exposure can predict neuropathic damage in rats several weeks later .

Effects of training on the extent of experimental myocardial infarction in aging rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The effects of exercise on the severity of isoproterenol - induced myocardial infarction were studied in female albino rats of 20 , 40 , 60 and 80 weeks of age

Intra - arterial BCNU chemotherapy for treatment of malignant gliomas of the central nervous system .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because of the rapid systemic clearance of BCNU ( 1 , 3 - bis - ( 2 - chloroethyl ) - 1 - nitrosourea ) , intra - arterial administration
O O O O O O O B O B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O
should provide a substantial advantage over intravenous administration for the treatment of malignant gliomas .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thirty - six patients were treated with BCNU every 6 to 8 weeks , either by transfemoral catheterization of the internal carotid or vertebral artery or through a fully implantable
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Twelve patients with Grade III or IV astrocytomas were treated after partial resection of the tumor without prior radiation therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After two to seven cycles of chemotherapy , nine patients showed a decrease in tumor size and surrounding edema on contrast - enhanced computerized tomography scans .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the nine responders , median duration of chemotherapy response from the time of operation was 25 weeks ( range 12 to more than 91 weeks ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The median duration of survival in the 12 patients was 54 weeks ( range 21 to more than 156 weeks ) , with an 18 - month survival rate of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
42 % .
O O O
Twenty - four patients with recurrent Grade

Blood pressure response to chronic low - dose intrarenal noradrenaline infusion in conscious rats .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Sodium chloride solution ( 0 . 9 % ) or noradrenaline in doses of 4 , 12 and 36 micrograms h - 1 kg - 1 was infused for five
B I O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
consecutive days , either intrarenally ( by a new technique ) or intravenously into rats with one kidney removed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Intrarenal infusion of noradrenaline caused hypertension at doses which did not do so when infused intravenously .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Intrarenal compared with intravenous infusion of noradrenaline caused higher plasma noradrenaline concentrations and a shift of the plasma noradrenaline concentration - blood pressure effect curve towards lower plasma noradrenaline levels
O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O
.
O
These results suggest that hypertension after chronic intrarenal noradrenaline infusion is produced by relatively higher levels of circulating noradrenaline and by triggering of an additional intrarenal pressor mechanism .

Age and renal clearance of cimetidine .
O O O O O B O
In 35 patients ( ages 20 to 86 yr ) receiving cimetidine therapeutically two serum samples and all urine formed in the interim were collected for analysis of cimetidine by
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
high - pressure liquid chromatography and for creatinine .
O O O O O O O B O
Cimetidine clearance decreased with age .
B O O O O O
The extrapolated 6 - hr serum concentration of cimetidine per unit dose , after intravenous cimetidine , increased with age of the patients .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
The ratio of cimetidine clearance to creatinine clearance ( Rc ) averaged 4 . 8 + / -
O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
2 . 0 , indicating net tubular secretion for cimetidine .
O O O O O O O O O B O
Rc seemed to be independent of age and decreased with increasing serum concentration of cimetidine , suggesting that secretion of cimetidine is a saturable process .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O
There was only one case of dementia possibly due to cimetidine ( with a drug level of 1 . 9 microgram / ml 6 hr after a dose ) in
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a group of 13 patients without liver or kidney disease who had cimetidine levels above 1 . 25 microgram / ml .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Thus , high cimetidine levels alone do not always induce dementia .

Attenuation of the lithium - induced diabetes - insipidus - like syndrome by amiloride in rats .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O
The effect of amiloride on lithium - induced polydipsia and polyuria and on the lithium concentration in the plasma , brain , kidney , thyroid and red blood cells was
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
investigated in rats , chronically treated with LiCl .
O O O O O O O B O
Amiloride reduced the drinking and urine volume of rats in an acute ( 6 or 12 h ) and a subacute ( 3 days ) experiment .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
6 h after the administration of amiloride , a reduction was observed in the lithium content of the renal medulla but not in the other organs studied .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At 12 h , all the tissues showed a slight increase in lithium levels .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
After 3 days of combined treatment , a marked elevation in plasma and tissue lithium levels accompanied a reduction in water intake .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
In all the experiments , the attenuation of the lithium - induced diabetes - insipidus - like syndrome by amiloride was accompanied by a reduction of the ratio between the
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
lithium concentration in the renal medulla and its levels in the blood and an elevation in the plasma potassium level .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
It is concluded that acute amiloride administration to lithium - treated patients suffering from polydipsia and polyuria might relieve these patients but prolonged amiloride supplementation would result in elevated
O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
lithium levels and might be hazardous .

Controlled study in agoraphobia with panic disorder .
O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
The widespread use of benzodiazepines has led to increasing recognition of their unwanted effects .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
The efficacy of alprazolam and placebo in panic disorder with agoraphobia , and the side - effect and adverse effect profiles of both drug groups were measured .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHOD :
O O
In London and Toronto 154 patients who met DSM - III criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobia were randomised to alprazolam or placebo .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Subjects in each drug group also received either exposure or relaxation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Treatment was from weeks 0 to 8 and was then tapered from weeks 8 to 16 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Mean alprazolam dose was 5 mg daily .
O B O O O O O O
Compared with placebo subjects , alprazolam patients developed more adverse reactions ( 21 % v . 0 % ) of depression , enuresis , disinhibition and aggression ; and more
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
side - effects , particularly sedation , irritability , impaired memory , weight loss and ataxia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Side - effects tended to diminish during treatment but remained significant at week 8 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Despite this , the drop - out rate was low .
O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Alprazolam caused side - effects and adverse effects during treatment but many patients were willing to accept these .

Sodium bicarbonate alleviates penile pain induced by intracavernous injections for erectile dysfunction .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O
In an attempt to determine whether penile pain associated with intracorporeal injections could be due to the acidity of the medication , we performed a randomized study comparing the incidence
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of penile pain following intracorporeal injections with or without the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the intracorporeal medications .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
A total of 38 consecutive patients who presented to our clinic with impotence received 0 . 2 ml .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of a combination of 3 drugs : 6 mg . papaverine , 100 micrograms .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O

B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the addition of sodium bicarbonate ( 0 . 03 mEq . )
O O O B I O O O O O O O
.
O
Of the 19 patients without sodium bicarbonate added to the medication 11 ( 58 % ) complained of penile pain due to the medication , while only 1 of the
O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
19 men ( 5 % ) who received sodium bicarbonate complained of penile pain .
O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
From these data we conclude that the penile pain following intracorporeal injections is most likely due to the acidity of the medication , which can be overcome by elevating the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pH to a neutral level .

Prospective study of the long - term effects of somatostatin analog ( octreotide ) on gallbladder function and gallstone formation in Chinese acromegalic patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
This article reports the changes in gallbladder function examined by ultrasonography in 20 Chinese patients with active acromegaly treated with sc injection of the somatostatin analog octreotide in dosages of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
300 - 1500 micrograms / day for a mean of 24 . 2 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
13 . 9 months .
O O O O O
During treatment with octreotide , 17 patients developed sludge , 10 had gallstones , and 1 developed acute cholecystitis requiring surgery .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In all of 7 patients examined acutely , gallbladder contractility was inhibited after a single 100 - micrograms injection .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 8 patients followed for 24 weeks , gallbladder contractility remained depressed throughout therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After withdrawal of octreotide in 10 patients without gallstones , 8 patients assessed had return of normal gallbladder contractility within 1 month .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 8 of the remaining 10 patients who developed gallstones during treatment , gallbladder contractility normalized in 5 patients ( 3 of whom has disappearance of their stones within 3
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
weeks ) , and remained depressed in 3 ( 2 of whom had stones present at 6 months ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our results suggest that the suppression of gallbladder contractility is the cause of the successive formation of bile sludge , gallstones , and cholecystitis during octreotide therapy in Chinese acromegalic
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
patients .
O O
It is therefore very important to follow the changes of gallbladder function during long - term octreotide therapy of acromegalic patients .

There was a significant 40 % improvement in the dyskinesia score without increase of parkinsonian motor disability .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ballistic and choreic dyskinesia were markedly ameliorated , whereas dystonia was not .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This study suggests that administration of low doses of beta - blockers may improve levodopa - induced ballistic and choreic dyskinesia in PD .

The first ultrastructural changes in structural elements of the blood - brain - barrier ( BBB ) in the cerebellar cortex were detectable after 3 months of the experiment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They became more severe in the later months of the experiment , and were most severe after 12 months , located mainly in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.

Lesions of the capillary included necrosis of endothelial cells .
O O O O O O O O O O
Organelles of these cells , in particular the mitochondria ( increased number and size , distinct degeneration of their matrix and cristae ) and Golgi apparatus were altered .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Reduced size of capillary lumen and occlusion were caused by swollen endothelial cells which had luminal protrusions and swollen microvilli .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Pressure on the vessel wall was produced by enlarged perivascular astrocytic processes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fragments of necrotic endothelial cells were in the vascular lumens and in these there was loosening and breaking of tight cellular junctions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Damage to the vascular basement lamina was also observed .
O O O O O O O O O O
Damage to the capillary was accompanied by marked damage to neuroglial cells , mainly to perivascular processes of astrocytes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The proliferation of astrocytes ( Bergmann 's in particular ) and occasionally of oligodendrocytes was found .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Alterations in the structural elements of the BBB coexisted with marked lesions of neurons of the cerebellum ( Purkinje cells are earliest ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In electron micrographs both luminal and antiluminal sides of the BBB of the cerebellar cortex had similar lesions .

Epidemic of liver disease caused by hydrochlorofluorocarbons used as ozone - sparing substitutes of chlorofluorocarbons .
O O O O O O B O O B O O O O B O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Hydrochlorofluorocarbons ( HCFCs ) are used increasingly in industry as substitutes for ozone - depleting chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) .
B O B O O O O O O O O O B O O B O B O O
Limited studies in animals indicate potential hepatotoxicity of some of these compounds .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We investigated an epidemic of liver disease in nine industrial workers who had had repeated accidental exposure to a mixture of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 , 1 - dichloro - 2 , 2 , 2 - trifluoroethane ( HCFC 123 ) and
B I I I I I I I I I I I I O B I O O
1 - chloro - 1 , 2 , 2 , 2 - tetrafluoroethane ( HCFC 124 ) .
B I I I I I I I I I I I I O B I O O
All nine exposed workers were affected to various degrees .
O O O O O O O O O O
Both compounds are metabolised in the same way as 1 - bromo - 1 - chloro - 2 , 2 , 2 - trifluoroethane ( halothane ) to form reactive
O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I O B O O O O
trifluoroacetyl halide intermediates , which have been implicated in the hepatotoxicity of halothane .
B O O O O O O O O O O O B O
We aimed to test whether HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver disease .
O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
For one severely affected worker liver biopsy and immunohistochemical stainings for the presence of trifluoroacetyl protein adducts were done .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
The serum of six affected workers and five controls was tested for autoantibodies that react with human liver cytochrome - P450 2E1 ( P450 2E1 ) and P58 protein disulphide
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
isomerase isoform ( P58 ) .
O O O O O O
FINDINGS :
O O
The liver biopsy sample showed hepatocellular necrosis which was prominent in perivenular zone three and extended focally from portal tracts to portal tracts and centrilobular areas ( bridging necrosis )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Trifluoroacetyl - adducted proteins were detected in surviving hepatocytes .
B O O O O O O O O O
Autoantibodies against P450 2E1 or P58 , previously associated with halothane hepatitis , were detected in the serum of five affected workers .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
INTERPRETATION :
O O
Repeated exposure of human beings to HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver injury in a large proportion of the exposed population .
O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although the exact mechanism of hepatotoxicity of these agents is not known , the results suggest that trifluoroacetyl - altered liver proteins are involved .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
In view of the potentially widespread use of these compounds , there is an urgent need to develop safer alternatives .

The effect of different anaesthetic agents in hearing loss following spinal anaesthesia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The cause of hearing loss after spinal anaesthesia is unknown .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Up until now , the only factor studied has been the effect of the diameter of the spinal needle on post - operative sensorineural hearing loss .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The aim of this study was to describe this hearing loss and to investigate other factors influencing the degree of hearing loss .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two groups of 22 similar patients were studied : one group received 6 mL prilocaine 2 % ; and the other received 3 mL bupivacaine 0 . 5 % .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Patients given prilocaine were more likely to develop hearing loss ( 10 out of 22 ) than those given bupivacaine ( 4 out of 22 ) ( P < 0
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
. 05 ) .
O O O O
The average hearing loss for speech frequencies was about 10 dB after prilocaine and 15 dB after bupivacaine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O
None of the patients complained of subjective hearing loss .
O O O O O O O O O O
Long - term follow - up of the patients was not possible .

A transient neurological deficit following intrathecal injection of 1 % hyperbaric bupivacaine for unilateral spinal anaesthesia .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
We describe a case of transient neurological deficit that occurred after unilateral spinal anaesthesia with 8 mg of 1 % hyperbaric bupivacaine slowly injected through a 25 - gauge pencil
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
- point spinal needle .
O O O O O
The surgery and anaesthesia were uneventful , but 3 days after surgery , the patient reported an area of hypoaesthesia over L3 - L4 dermatomes of the leg which had
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
been operated on ( loss of pinprick sensation ) without reduction in muscular strength .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sensation in this area returned to normal over the following 2 weeks .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Prospective multicentre studies with a large population and a long follow - up should be performed in order to evaluate the incidence of this unusual side effect .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , we suggest that a low solution concentration should be preferred for unilateral spinal anaesthesia with a hyperbaric anaesthetic solution ( if pencil - point needle and slow injection
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rate are employed ) , in order to minimize the risk of a localized high peak anaesthetic concentration , which might lead to a transient neurological deficit .

Both plasma pethidine and norpethidine were elevated in the range associated with clinical manifestations of central nervous system excitation .
O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No other risk factors for CNS toxicity were identified .

Drug - associated acute - onset vanishing bile duct and Stevens - Johnson syndromes in a child .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Acute vanishing bile duct syndrome is a rare but established cause of progressive cholestasis in adults , is most often drug or toxin related , and is of unknown pathogenesis
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
It has not been reported previously in children .
O O O O O O O O O
Stevens - Johnson syndrome is a well - recognized immune complex - mediated hypersensitivity reaction that affects all age groups , is drug or infection induced , and has classic
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
systemic , mucosal , and dermatologic manifestations .
O O O O O O O O
A previously healthy child who developed acute , severe , rapidly progressive vanishing bile duct syndrome shortly after Stevens - Johnson syndrome is described ; this was temporally associated with
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ibuprofen use .
B O O
Despite therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid , prednisone , and then tacrolimus , her cholestatic disease was unrelenting , with cirrhosis shown by biopsy 6 months after presentation .
O O O B I O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This case documents acute drug - related vanishing bile duct syndrome in the pediatric age group and suggests shared immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of both Stevens - Johnson syndrome

and vanishing bile duct syndrome .

High incidence of primary pulmonary hypertension associated with appetite suppressants in Belgium .
O O O O O O O O B I O O O
Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare , progressive and incurable disease , which has been associated with the intake of appetite suppressant drugs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O
The importance of this association was evaluated in Belgium while this country still had no restriction on the prescription of appetite suppressants .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Thirty - five patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and 85 matched controls were recruited over 32 months ( 1992 - 1994 ) in Belgium .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Exposure to appetite - suppressants was assessed on the basis of hospital records and standardized interview .
O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
Twenty - three of the patients had previously taken appetite suppressants , mainly fenfluramines , as compared with only 5 of the controls ( 66 versus 6 % , p
O O O O O O O O O B I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
< 0 . 0001 ) .
O O O O O O
Five patients died before the interview , all of them had taken appetite suppressants .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
In 8 patients the diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension was uncertain , 5 of them had taken appetite suppressants .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
The patients who had been exposed to appetite suppressants tended to be on average more severely ill , and to have a shorter median delay between onset of symptoms and
O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
diagnosis .
O O
A policy of unrestricted prescription of appetite suppressants may lead to a high incidence of associated primary pulmonary hypertension .
O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
Intake of appetite suppressants may accelerate the progression of the disease .

Cocaine - induced mood disorder : prevalence rates and psychiatric symptoms in an outpatient cocaine - dependent sample .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
This paper attempts to examine and compare prevalence rates and symptom patterns of DSM substance - induced and other mood disorders .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
243 cocaine - dependent outpatients with cocaine - induced mood disorder ( CIMD ) , other mood disorders , or no mood disorder were compared on measures of psychiatric symptoms
O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
The prevalence rate for CIMD was 12 % at baseline .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Introduction of the DSM - IV diagnosis of CIMD did not substantially affect rates of the other depressive disorders .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients with CIMD had symptom severity levels between those of patients with and without a mood disorder .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings suggest some validity for the new DSM - IV diagnosis of CIMD , but also suggest that it requires further specification and replication .

Hemolysis of human erythrocytes induced by tamoxifen is related to disruption of membrane structure .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Tamoxifen ( TAM ) , the antiestrogenic drug most widely prescribed in the chemotherapy of breast cancer , induces changes in normal discoid shape of erythrocytes and hemolytic anemia .
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This work evaluates the effects of TAM on isolated human erythrocytes , attempting to identify the underlying mechanisms on TAM - induced hemolytic anemia and the involvement of biomembranes in
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
its cytostatic action mechanisms .
O O O O O
TAM induces hemolysis of erythrocytes as a function of concentration .
B O O O O O O O O O O
The extension of hemolysis is variable with erythrocyte samples , but 12 . 5 microM TAM induces total hemolysis of all tested suspensions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Despite inducing extensive erythrocyte lysis , TAM does not shift the osmotic fragility curves of erythrocytes .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
The hemolytic effect of TAM is prevented by low concentrations of alpha - tocopherol ( alpha - T ) and alpha - tocopherol acetate ( alpha - TAc ) (
O O O O B O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O B I I I O B I I O O
inactivated functional hydroxyl ) indicating that TAM - induced hemolysis is not related to oxidative membrane damage .
O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
This was further evidenced by absence of oxygen consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with TAM - induced hemolysis .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Furthermore , it was observed that TAM inhibits the peroxidation of human erythrocytes induced by AAPH , thus ruling out TAM - induced cell oxidative stress .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O
Hemolysis caused by TAM was not preceded by the leakage of K ( + ) from the cells , also excluding a colloid - osmotic type mechanism of hemolysis ,
O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves .
O O O O O O O O O
However , TAM induces release of peripheral proteins of membrane - cytoskeleton and cytosol proteins essentially bound to band 3 .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Either alpha - T or alpha - TAc increases membrane packing and prevents TAM partition into model membranes .
O B I I O B I I O O O O O B O O O O O
These effects suggest that the protection from hemolysis by tocopherols is related to a decreased TAM incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
avoided .
O O
Therefore , TAM - induced hemolysis results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane , leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by its high partition in the membrane .
O O O O O O O O
These defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by TAM , resulting in hemolytic anemia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Additionally , since membrane leakage is a final stage of cytotoxicity , the disruption of the structural characteristics of biomembranes by TAM may contribute to the multiple mechanisms of its
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
anticancer action .

Changes of sodium and ATP affinities of the cardiac ( Na , K ) - ATPase during and after nitric oxide deficient hypertension .
O O B O B O O O O O B O B O O O O O O B I O O O
In the cardiovascular system , NO is involved in the regulation of a variety of functions .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Inhibition of NO synthesis induces sustained hypertension .
O O B O O O O O
In several models of hypertension , elevation of intracellular sodium level was documented in cardiac tissue .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
To assess the molecular basis of disturbances in transmembraneous transport of Na + , we studied the response of cardiac ( Na , K ) - ATPase to NO -
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O B O
deficient hypertension induced in rats by NO - synthase inhibition with 40 mg / kg / day N ( G ) - nitro - L - arginine methyl ester (
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I O
L - NAME ) for 4 four weeks .
B I I O O O O O O
After 4 - week administration of L - NAME , the systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) increased by 36 % .
O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two weeks after terminating the treatment , the SBP recovered to control value .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When activating the ( Na , K ) - ATPase with its substrate ATP , no changes in Km and Vmax values were observed in NO - deficient rats .
O O O O B O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
During activation with Na + , the Vmax remained unchanged , however the K ( Na ) increased by 50 % , indicating a profound decrease in the affinity of
O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the Na + - binding site in NO - deficient rats .
O B O O O O O B O O O O
After recovery from hypertension , the activity of ( Na , K ) - ATPase increased , due to higher affinity of the ATP - binding site , as revealed
O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
from the lowered Km value for ATP .
O O O O O O B O
The K ( Na ) value for Na + returned to control value .
O B O B O O O B O O O O O O
Inhibition of NO - synthase induced a reversible hypertension accompanied by depressed Na + - extrusion from cardiac cells as a consequence of deteriorated Na + - binding properties of
O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
the ( Na , K ) - ATPase .
O O B O B O O O O
After recovery of blood pressure to control values , the extrusion of Na + from cardiac cells was normalized , as revealed by restoration of the ( Na ,

Effects of long - term pretreatment with isoproterenol on bromocriptine - induced tachycardia in conscious rats .
O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O
It has been shown that bromocriptine - induced tachycardia , which persisted after adrenalectomy , is ( i ) mediated by central dopamine D2 receptor activation and ( ii )
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
reduced by 5 - day isoproterenol pretreatment , supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with isoproterenol could abolish bromocriptine - induced tachycardia in conscious rats .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O
Isoproterenol pretreatment for 15 days caused cardiac hypertrophy without affecting baseline blood pressure and heart rate .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In control rats , intravenous bromocriptine ( 150 microg / kg ) induced significant hypotension and tachycardia .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bromocriptine - induced hypotension was unaffected by isoproterenol pretreatment , while tachycardia was reversed to significant bradycardia , an effect that was partly reduced by i . v .
B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
domperidone ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) .
B O O O O O O O O O
Neither cardiac vagal nor sympathetic tone was altered by isoproterenol pretreatment .
O O O O O O O O O B O O
In isolated perfused heart preparations from isoproterenol - pretreated rats , the isoproterenol - induced maximal increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly reduced , compared with saline -
O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pretreated rats ( the EC50 of the isoproterenol - induced increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was enhanced approximately 22 - fold ) .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results show that 15 - day isoproterenol pretreatment not only abolished but reversed bromocriptine - induced tachycardia to bradycardia , an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
beta - adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They suggest that , in normal conscious rats , the central tachycardia of bromocriptine appears to predominate and to mask the bradycardia of this agonist at peripheral dopamine D2 receptors
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O

A developmental analysis of clonidine 's effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production in infant rats .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Under controlled conditions , infant rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations during extreme cold exposure and after administration of the alpha ( 2 ) adrenoceptor agonist , clonidine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Previous investigations have determined that , in response to clonidine , ultrasound production increases through the 2nd - week postpartum and decreases thereafter .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Given that sympathetic neural dominance exhibits a similar developmental pattern , and given that clonidine induces sympathetic withdrawal and bradycardia , we hypothesized that clonidine 's developmental effects on cardiac
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
rate and ultrasound production would mirror each other .
O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , in the present experiment , the effects of clonidine administration ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) on cardiac rate and ultrasound production were examined in 2
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- , 8 - , 15 - , and 20 - day - old rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Age - related changes in ultrasound production corresponded with changes in cardiovascular variables , including baseline cardiac rate and clonidine - induced bradycardia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
This experiment is discussed with regard to the hypothesis that ultrasound production is the acoustic by - product of a physiological maneuver that compensates for clonidine 's detrimental effects on
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
cardiovascular function .

Differential effects of systemically administered ketamine and lidocaine on dynamic and static hyperalgesia induced by intradermal capsaicin in humans .
O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O B O O O

O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
capsaicin .
B O
In a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , crossover study , we studied 12 volunteers in three experiments .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Capsaicin 100 micrograms was injected intradermally on the volar forearm followed by an i . v .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
infusion of ketamine ( bolus 0 . 1 mg kg - 1 over 10 min followed by infusion of 7 micrograms kg - 1 min - 1 ) ,
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lidocaine 5 mg kg - 1 or saline for 50 min .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
Infusion started 15 min after injection of capsaicin .
O O O O O O O B O
The following were measured : spontaneous pain , pain evoked by punctate and brush stimuli ( VAS ) , and areas of brush - evoked and punctate - evoked hyperalgesia
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Ketamine reduced both the area of brush - evoked and punctate - evoked hyperalgesia significantly and it tended to reduce brush - evoked pain .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lidocaine reduced the area of punctate - evoked hyperalgesia significantly .
B O O O O O O O O O O
It tended to reduce VAS scores of spontaneous pain but had no effect on evoked pain .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The differential effects of ketamine and lidocaine on static and dynamic hyperalgesia suggest that the two types of hyperalgesia are mediated by separate mechanisms and have a distinct pharmacology .

Cyclosporine and tacrolimus - associated thrombotic microangiopathy .
B O B O O O O O
The development of thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) associated with the use of cyclosporine has been well documented .

O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , for recipients of organ transplantation , removing the inciting agent is not without the attendant risk of precipitating acute rejection and graft loss .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The last decade has seen the emergence of tacrolimus as a potent immunosuppressive agent with mechanisms of action virtually identical to those of cyclosporine .

As a result , switching to tacrolimus has been reported to be a viable therapeutic option in the setting of cyclosporine - induced TMA .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
With the more widespread application of tacrolimus in organ transplantation , tacrolimus - associated TMA has also been recognized .
O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O
However , literature regarding the incidence of the recurrence of TMA in patients exposed sequentially to cyclosporine and tacrolimus is limited .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O
We report a case of a living donor renal transplant recipient who developed cyclosporine - induced TMA that responded to the withdrawal of cyclosporine in conjunction with plasmapheresis and fresh
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
frozen plasma replacement therapy .
O O O O O
Introduction of tacrolimus as an alternative immunosuppressive agent resulted in the recurrence of TMA and the subsequent loss of the renal allograft .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients who are switched from cyclosporine to tacrolimus or vice versa should be closely monitored for the signs and symptoms of recurrent TMA .

Repeated transient anuria following losartan administration in a patient with a solitary kidney .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
We report the case of a 70 - year - old hypertensive man with a solitary kidney and chronic renal insufficiency who developed two episodes of transient anuria after
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
losartan administration .
B O O
He was hospitalized for a myocardial infarction with pulmonary edema , treated with high - dose diuretics .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Due to severe systolic dysfunction losartan was prescribed .
O O O O O B O O O
Surprisingly , the first dose of 50 mg of losartan resulted in a sudden anuria , which lasted eight hours despite high - dose furosemide and amine infusion .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O
One week later , by mistake , losartan was prescribed again and after the second dose of 50 mg , the patient developed a second episode of transient anuria lasting
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
10 hours .
O O O
During these two episodes , his blood pressure diminished but no severe hypotension was noted .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ultimately , an arteriography showed a 70 - 80 % renal artery stenosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this patient , renal artery stenosis combined with heart failure and diuretic therapy certainly resulted in a strong activation of the renin - angiotensin system ( RAS ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Under such conditions , angiotensin II receptor blockade by losartan probably induced a critical fall in glomerular filtration pressure .
O O O O B I O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
This case report highlights the fact that the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan can cause serious unexpected complications in patients with renovascular disease and should be used with extreme caution

In vivo protection of dna damage associated apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths during acetaminophen - induced nephrotoxicity , amiodarone - induced lung toxicity and doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity by a
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O
novel IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract .
O B I I I I O
Grape seed extract , primarily a mixture of proanthocyanidins , has been shown to modulate a wide - range of biological , pharmacological and toxicological effects which are mainly cytoprotective
B I I O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
This study assessed the ability of IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract ( GSPE ) to prevent acetaminophen ( AAP ) - induced nephrotoxicity , amiodarone ( AMI ) - induced
O O O O O O B I I I I O B O O O B O B O O O O O B O B O O O
lung toxicity , and doxorubicin ( DOX ) - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .
O O O O B O B O O O O O O O
Experimental design consisted of four groups : control ( vehicle alone ) , GSPE alone , drug alone and GSPE + drug .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O
For the cytoprotection study , animals were orally gavaged 100 mg / Kg GSPE for 7 - 10 days followed by i . p .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
injections of organ specific three drugs ( AAP : 500 mg / Kg for 24 h ; AMI : 50 mg / Kg / day for four days ;
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
DOX : 20 mg / Kg for 48 h ) .
B O O O O O O O O O O
Parameters of study included analysis of serum chemistry ( ALT , BUN and CPK ) , and orderly fragmentation of genomic DNA ( both endonuclease - dependent and independent )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in addition to microscopic evaluation of damage and / or protection in corresponding PAS stained tissues .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Results indicate that GSPE preexposure prior to AAP , AMI and DOX , provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes ( ALT , BUN and CPK )
O O O B O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, and significantly reduced DNA fragmentation .
O O O O O O O
Histopathological examination of kidney , heart and lung sections revealed moderate to massive tissue damage with a variety of morphological aberrations by all the three drugs in the absence of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
GSPE preexposure than in its presence .
B O O O O O O
GSPE + drug exposed tissues exhibited minor residual damage or near total recovery .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Additionally , histopathological alterations mirrored both serum chemistry changes and the pattern of DNA fragmentation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Interestingly , all the drugs , such as , AAP , AMI and DOX induced apoptotic death in addition to necrosis in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked
O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by GSPE .
O B O
Since AAP , AMI and DOX undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo , the protection by GSPE may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism
O B O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
and / or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals .
O O O O O O O O
In addition , its ' presumed contribution to DNA repair may be another important attribute , which played a role in the chemoprevention process .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Additionally , this may have been the first report on AMI - induced apoptotic death in the lung tissue .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Taken together , these events undoubtedly establish GSPE 's abundant bioavailability , and the power to defend multiple target organs from toxic assaults induced by structurally diverse and functionally different

entities in vivo .

Metamizol potentiates morphine antinociception but not constipation after chronic treatment .

This work evaluates the antinociceptive and constipating effects of the combination of 3 . 2 mg / kg s . c .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
morphine with 177 . 8 mg / kg s . c .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
metamizol in acutely and chronically treated ( once a day for 12 days ) rats .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On the 13th day , antinociceptive effects were assessed using a model of inflammatory nociception , pain - induced functional impairment model , and the charcoal meal test was used
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
to evaluate the intestinal transit .
O O O O O O
Simultaneous administration of morphine with metamizol resulted in a markedly antinociceptive potentiation and an increasing of the duration of action after a single ( 298 + / - 7 vs
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Antinociceptive effect of morphine was reduced in chronically treated rats ( 39 + / - 10 vs . 18 + / - 5 au ) while the combination - induced
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
antinociception was remained similar as an acute treatment ( 298 + / - 7 vs . 280 + / - 17 au ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Acute antinociceptive effects of the combination were partially prevented by 3 . 2 mg / kg naloxone s . c .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
( P < 0 . 05 ) , suggesting the partial involvement of the opioidergic system in the synergism observed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In independent groups , morphine inhibited the intestinal transit in 48 + / - 4 % and 38 + / - 4 % after acute and chronic treatment , respectively
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, suggesting that tolerance did not develop to the constipating effects .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The combination inhibited intestinal transit similar to that produced by morphine regardless of the time of treatment , suggesting that metamizol did not potentiate morphine - induced constipation .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O
These findings show a significant interaction between morphine and metamizol in chronically treated rats , suggesting that this combination could be useful for the treatment of chronic pain .

Ifosfamide encephalopathy presenting with asterixis .
B O O O O O
CNS toxic effects of the antineoplastic agent ifosfamide ( IFX ) are frequent and include a variety of neurological symptoms that can limit drug use .
O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We report a case of a 51 - year - old man who developed severe , disabling negative myoclonus of the upper and lower extremities after the infusion of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ifosfamide for plasmacytoma .
B O O O
He was awake , revealed no changes of mental status and at rest there were no further motor symptoms .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cranial magnetic resonance imaging and extensive laboratory studies failed to reveal structural lesions of the brain and metabolic abnormalities .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An electroencephalogram showed continuous , generalized irregular slowing with admixed periodic triphasic waves indicating symptomatic encephalopathy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The administration of ifosfamide was discontinued and within 12 h the asterixis resolved completely .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
In the patient described , the presence of asterixis during infusion of ifosfamide , normal laboratory findings and imaging studies and the resolution of symptoms following the discontinuation of the
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

OBJECTIVES :
O O
Given its preclinical success for treating substance abuse and the increased risk of visual field defects ( VFD ) associated with cumulative lifetime exposure , we explored the effects of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sub - chronic low dose GVG on cocaine - induced increases in nucleus accumbens ( NAcc ) dopamine ( DA ) .
O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O B O B O O
METHODS :
O O
Using in vivo microdialysis , we compared acute exposure ( 450 mg / kg ) to an identical sub - chronic exposure ( 150 mg / kg per day for
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 days ) , followed by 1 - or 3 - day washout .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Finally , we examined the low dose of 150 mg / kg ( 50 mg / kg per day ) using a similar washout period .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Sub - chronic GVG exposure inhibited the effect of cocaine for 3 days , which exceeded in magnitude and duration the identical acute dose .
O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Sub - chronic low dose GVG potentiates and extends the inhibition of cocaine - induced increases in dopamine , effectively reducing cumulative exposures and the risk for VFDS .

Amount of bleeding and hematoma size in the collagenase - induced intracerebral hemorrhage rat model .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The aggravated risk on intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) with drugs used for stroke patients should be estimated carefully .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We therefore established sensitive quantification methods and provided a rat ICH model for detection of ICH deterioration .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In ICH intrastriatally induced by 0 . 014 - unit , 0 . 070 - unit , and 0 . 350 - unit collagenase ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the amount of bleeding was measured using a hemoglobin assay developed in the present study and was compared with the morphologically determined hematoma volume .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The blood amounts and hematoma volumes were significantly correlated , and the hematoma induced by 0 . 014 - unit collagenase was adequate to detect ICH deterioration .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In ICH induction using 0 . 014 - unit collagenase , heparin enhanced the hematoma volume 3 . 4 - fold over that seen in control ICH animals and the
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bleeding 7 . 6 - fold .
O O O O O O O
Data suggest that this sensitive hemoglobin assay is useful for ICH detection , and that a model with a small ICH induced with a low - dose collagenase should be
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
used for evaluation of drugs that may affect ICH .

Estradiol reduces seizure - induced hippocampal injury in ovariectomized female but not in male rats .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Estrogens protect ovariectomized rats from hippocampal injury induced by kainic acid - induced status epilepticus ( SE ) .
O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
We compared the effects of 17beta - estradiol in adult male and ovariectomized female rats subjected to lithium - pilocarpine - induced SE .
O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O
Rats received subcutaneous injections of 17beta - estradiol ( 2 microg / rat ) or oil once daily for four consecutive days .
O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
SE was induced 20 h following the second injection and terminated 3 h later .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The extent of silver - stained CA3 and CA1 hippocampal neurons was evaluated 2 days after SE .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
17beta - Estradiol did not alter the onset of first clonus in ovariectomized rats but accelerated it in males .
B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
17beta - Estradiol reduced the argyrophilic neurons in the CA1 and CA3 - C sectors of ovariectomized rats .
B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In males , estradiol increased the total damage score .
O O O B O O O O O O
These findings suggest that the effects of estradiol on seizure threshold and damage may be altered by sex - related differences in the hormonal environment .

Delirium during clozapine treatment : incidence and associated risk factors .
O O B O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Incidence and risk factors for delirium during clozapine treatment require further clarification .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
We used computerized pharmacy records to identify all adult psychiatric inpatients treated with clozapine ( 1995 - 96 ) , reviewed their medical records to score incidence and severity of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
delirium , and tested associations with potential risk factors .
O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Subjects ( n = 139 ) were 72 women and 67 men , aged 40 . 8 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
12 . 1 years , hospitalized for 24 . 9 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
23 . 3 days , and given clozapine , gradually increased to an average daily dose of 282 + / -
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
203 mg ( 3 . 45 + / -
O O O O O O O O O
2 . 45 mg / kg ) for 18 . 9 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
16 . 4 days .
O O O O O
Delirium was diagnosed in 14 ( 10 . 1 % incidence , or 1 . 48 cases / person - years of exposure ) ; 71 . 4 % of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cases were moderate or severe .
O O O O O O
Associated factors were co - treatment with other centrally antimuscarinic agents , poor clinical outcome , older age , and longer hospitalization ( by 17 . 5 days , increasing
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cost ) ; sex , diagnosis or medical co - morbidity , and daily clozapine dose , which fell with age , were unrelated .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Delirium was found in 10 % of clozapine - treated inpatients , particularly in older patients exposed to other central anticholinergics .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Delirium was inconsistently recognized clinically in milder cases and was associated with increased length - of - stay and higher costs , and inferior clinical outcome .

Ketoconazole - induced neurologic sequelae .
B O O O O O
A 77 - y - old patient developed weakness of extremities , legs paralysis , dysarthria and tremor 1 h after ingestion of 200 mg ketoconazole for the first time
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
in his life .
O O O O
All complaints faded away within 24 h .
O O O O O O O O
Few days later , the patient used another 200 mg ketoconazole tablet , and within an hour experienced a similar clinical picture , which resolved again spontaneously within hours .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Laboratory evaluations , including head CT scan , were normal .
O O O O O O O O O O O
This case illustrates the need for close vigilance in adverse drug reactions , particularly in the elderly .

Noxious chemical stimulation of rat facial mucosa increases intracranial blood flow through a trigemino - parasympathetic reflex - - an experimental model for vascular dysfunctions in cluster headache .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cluster headache is characterized by typical autonomic dysfunctions including facial and intracranial vascular disturbances .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both the trigeminal and the cranial parasympathetic systems may be involved in mediating these dysfunctions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An experimental model was developed in the rat to measure changes in lacrimation and intracranial blood flow following noxious chemical stimulation of facial mucosa .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Blood flow was monitored in arteries of the exposed cranial dura mater and the parietal cortex using laser Doppler flowmetry .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Capsaicin ( 0 . 01 - 1 mm ) applied to oral or nasal mucosa induced increases in dural and cortical blood flow and provoked lacrimation .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These responses were blocked by systemic pre - administration of hexamethonium chloride ( 20 mg / kg ) .
O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
The evoked increases in dural blood flow were also abolished by topical pre - administration of atropine ( 1 mm ) and [ Lys1 , Pro2 , 5 , Arg3
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, 4 , Tyr6 ] - VIP ( 0 . 1 mm ) , a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP ) antagonist , onto the exposed dura mater .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We conclude that noxious stimulation of facial mucosa increases intracranial blood flow and lacrimation via a trigemino - parasympathetic reflex .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The blood flow responses seem to be mediated by the release of acetylcholine and VIP within the meninges .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Similar mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of cluster headache .

Recurrent excitation in the dentate gyrus of a murine model of temporal lobe epilepsy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Similar to rats , systemic pilocarpine injection causes status epilepticus ( SE ) and the eventual development of spontaneous seizures and mossy fiber sprouting in C57BL / 6 and CD1
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mice , but the physiological correlates of these events have not been identified in mice .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Population responses in granule cells of the dentate gyrus were examined in transverse slices of the ventral hippocampus from pilocarpine - treated and untreated mice .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
In Mg ( 2 + ) - free bathing medium containing bicuculline , conditions designed to increase excitability in the slices , electrical stimulation of the hilus resulted in a
O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
single population spike in granule cells from control mice and pilocarpine - treated mice that did not experience SE .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
In SE survivors , similar stimulation resulted in a population spike followed , at a variable latency , by negative DC shifts and repetitive afterdischarges of 3 - 60 s
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
duration , which were blocked by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists .
O O O O O O O B O O O
Focal glutamate photostimulation of the granule cell layer at sites distant from the recording pipette resulted in population responses of 1 - 30 s duration in slices from SE survivors
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but not other groups .
O O O O O
These data support the hypothesis that SE - induced mossy fiber sprouting and synaptic reorganization are relevant characteristics of seizure development in these murine strains , resembling rat models of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
human temporal lobe epilepsy .

The alpha3 and beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits are necessary for nicotine - induced seizures and hypolocomotion in mice .
O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Binding of nicotine to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) elicits a series of dose - dependent behaviors that go from altered exploration , sedation , and tremors , to
O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seizures and death .
O O O O
nAChRs are pentameric ion channels usually composed of alpha and beta subunits .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A gene cluster comprises the alpha3 , alpha5 and beta4 subunits , which coassemble to form functional receptors .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We examined the role of the beta4 subunits in nicotine - induced seizures and hypolocomotion in beta4 homozygous null ( beta4 - / - ) and alpha3 heterozygous ( +
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
/ - ) mice .
O O O O O
beta4 - / - mice were less sensitive to the effects of nicotine both at low doses , measured as decreased exploration in an open field , and at high
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
doses , measured as sensitivity to nicotine - induced seizures .
O O O O O O B O O O O
Using in situ hybridization probes for the alpha3 and alpha5 subunits , we showed that alpha5 mRNA levels are unchanged , whereas alpha3 mRNA levels are selectively decreased in the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb , and the inferior and the superior colliculus of beta4 - / - brains .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
alpha3 + / -
O O O O
mice were partially resistant to nicotine - induced seizures when compared to wild - type littermates .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
mRNA levels for the alpha5 and the beta4 subunits were unchanged in alpha3 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
brains .
O O
Together , these results suggest that the beta4 and the alpha3 subunits are mediators of nicotine - induced seizures and hypolocomotion .

A 14 - year - old girl is reported with recurrent , azithromycin - induced , acute interstitial nephritis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The second episode was more severe than the first ; and although both were treated with intensive corticosteroid therapy , renal function remained impaired .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although most cases of antibiotic induced acute interstitial nephritis are benign and self - limited , some patients are at risk for permanent renal injury .

Valproate - induced encephalopathy .
B O O O O
Valproate - induced encephalopathy is a rare syndrome that may manifest in otherwise normal epileptic individuals .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It may even present in patients who have tolerated this medicine well in the past .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is usually but not necessarily associated with hyperammonemia .
O O O O O O O O O O
The EEG shows characteristic triphasic waves in most patients with this complication .

Nitro - L - arginine methyl ester : a potential protector against gentamicin ototoxicity .
B I I I I I I O O O O O B O O
The nitric oxide ( NO ) inhibitor nitro - L - arginine methyl ester ( L - NAME ) may act as an otoprotectant against high - frequency hearing loss

caused by gentamicin , but further studies are needed to confirm this .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Aminoglycoside antibiotics are still widely used by virtue of their efficacy and low cost .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their ototoxicity is a serious health problem and , as their ototoxic mechanism involves the production of NO , we need to assess the use of NO inhibitors for the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O
prevention of aminoglycoside - induced sensorineural hearing loss .
O O B O O O O O O
In this experimental study we used 30 Sprague - Dawley rats , 27 of which had gentamicin instilled into the middle ear .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The otoprotectant L - NAME was administered topically to 12 / 27 animals .
O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
Its effect was determined in terms of attenuation of hearing loss , measured by shifts in the auditory brainstem response threshold .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
L - NAME reduced gentamicin - induced hearing loss in the high - frequency range , but gave no protection in the middle or low frequencies .

Cerebral vasculitis following oral methylphenidate intake in an adult : a case report .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Methylphenidate is structurally and functionally similar to amphetamine .
B O O O O O O B O
Cerebral vasculitis associated with amphetamine abuse is well documented , and in rare cases ischaemic stroke has been reported after methylphenidate intake in children .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
We report the case of a 63 - year - old female who was treated with methylphenidate due to hyperactivity and suffered from multiple ischaemic strokes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
We consider drug - induced cerebral vasculitis as the most likely cause of recurrent ischaemic strokes in the absence of any pathological findings during the diagnostic work - up .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We conclude that methylphenidate mediated vasculitis should be considered in patients with neurological symptoms and a history of methylphenidate therapy .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
This potential side - effect , though very rare , represents one more reason to be very restrictive in the use of methylphenidate .

tland , Sweden .
O O O O
METHODS :
O O
All patients with a diagnosed cerebral haemorrhage at three hospitals during the period 2000 - 2002 were identified .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Medical records were studied retrospectively to evaluate whether warfarin and warfarin - drug interactions could have caused the cerebral haemorrhage .
O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
The proportion of possibly avoidable cases due to drug interactions was estimated .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Among 593 patients with cerebral haemorrhage , 59 ( 10 % ) were assessed as related to warfarin treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
This imply an incidence of 1 . 7 / 100 , 000 treatment years .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of the 59 cases , 26 ( 44 % ) had a fatal outcome , compared to 136 ( 25 % ) among the non - warfarin patients ( p
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
< 0 . 01 ) .
O O O O O O
A warfarin - drug interaction could have contributed to the haemorrhage in 24 ( 41 % ) of the warfarin patients and in 7 of these ( 12 % )
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
the bleeding complication was considered being possible to avoid .
O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Warfarin - induced cerebral haemorrhages are a major clinical problem with a high fatality rate .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Almost half of the cases was related to a warfarin - drug interaction .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
A significant proportion of warfarin - related cerebral haemorrhages might have been prevented if greater caution had been taken when prescribing drugs known to interact with warfarin .

Cardiac Angiography in Renally Impaired Patients ( CARE ) study : a randomized double - blind trial of contrast - induced nephropathy in patients with chronic kidney disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
No direct comparisons exist of the renal tolerability of the low - osmolality contrast medium iopamidol with that of the iso - osmolality contrast medium iodixanol in high - risk
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I B O O O O O O O B I B O O O O
patients .
O O
METHODS AND RESULTS :
O O O O
The present study is a multicenter , randomized , double - blind comparison of iopamidol and iodixanol in patients with chronic kidney disease ( estimated glomerular filtration rate , 20
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to 59 mL / min ) who underwent cardiac angiography or percutaneous coronary interventions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Serum creatinine ( SCr ) levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate were assessed at baseline and 2 to 5 days after receiving medications .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The primary outcome was a postdose SCr increase > or = 0 . 5 mg / dL ( 44 . 2 micromol / L ) over baseline .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Secondary outcomes were a postdose SCr increase > or = 25 % , a postdose estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease of > or = 25 % , and the mean
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
peak change in SCr .
O O O O O
In 414 patients , contrast volume , presence of diabetes mellitus , use of N - acetylcysteine , mean baseline SCr , and estimated glomerular filtration rate were comparable in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the 2 groups .
O O O O
SCr increases > or = 0 . 5 mg / dL occurred in 4 . 4 % ( 9 of 204 patients ) after iopamidol and 6 . 7 %
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
( 14 of 210 patients ) after iodixanol ( P = 0 . 39 ) , whereas rates of SCr increases > or = 25 % were 9 . 8
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
% and 12 . 4 % , respectively ( P = 0 . 44 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In patients with diabetes , SCr increases > or = 0 . 5 mg / dL were 5 . 1 % ( 4 of 78 patients ) with iopamidol and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
13 . 0 % ( 12 of 92 patients ) with iodixanol ( P = 0 . 11 ) , whereas SCr increases > or = 25 % were 10
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
. 3 % and 15 . 2 % , respectively ( P = 0 . 37 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mean post - SCr increases were significantly less with iopamidol ( all patients : 0 . 07 versus 0 . 12 mg / dL , 6 . 2 versus 10
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
. 6 micromol / L , P = 0 . 03 ; patients with diabetes : 0 . 07 versus 0 . 16 mg / dL , 6 . 2
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
versus 14 . 1 micromol / L , P = 0 . 01 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
The rate of contrast - induced nephropathy , defined by multiple end points , is not statistically different after the intraarterial administration of iopamidol or iodixanol to high - risk
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O

A novel compound , maltolyl p - coumarate , attenuates cognitive deficits and shows neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo dementia models .
O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To develop a novel and effective drug that could enhance cognitive function and neuroprotection , we newly synthesized maltolyl p - coumarate by the esterification of maltol and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O B O
p - coumaric acid .
B I I I O
In the present study , we investigated whether maltolyl p - coumarate could improve cognitive decline in scopolamine - injected rats and in
O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B O O O O O
amyloid beta peptide ( 1 - 42 ) - infused rats .
B I I I I I I I O O O O
Maltolyl p - coumarate was found to attenuate cognitive deficits in both rat models using passive avoidance test and to reduce apoptotic cell death observed in the hippocampus of the
B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
amyloid beta peptide ( 1 - 42 ) - infused rats .
B I I I I I I I O O O O
We also examined the neuroprotective effects of maltolyl p - coumarate in vitro using SH - SY5Y cells .
O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O
Cells were pretreated with maltolyl p - coumarate , before exposed to amyloid beta peptide ( 1 - 42 ) , glutamate or H2O2 .
O O O O B I I I O O O O B I I I I I I I O B O B O
We found that maltolyl p - coumarate significantly decreased apoptotic cell death and reduced reactive oxygen species , cytochrome c release , and caspase 3 activation .
O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Taking these in vitro and in vivo results together , our study suggests that maltolyl p - coumarate is a potentially effective candidate against Alzheimer 's disease that is characterized
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
by wide spread neuronal death and progressive decline of cognitive function .

Interaction between warfarin and levofloxacin : case series .
O O B O B O O O O
Warfarin is the most widely used oral anticoagulant and is indicated for many clinical conditions .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Levofloxacin , a fluoroquinolone , is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in clinical practice and is effective against Gram - positive , Gram - negative , and atypical
B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bacteria .
O O
While small prospective studies have not revealed any significant drug - drug interaction between warfarin and levofloxacin , several case reports have indicated that levofloxacin may significantly potentiate the anticoagulation

O O B O
We report 3 cases of serious bleeding complications that appear to be the result of the interaction between warfarin and levofloxacin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
Physicians should be aware of this potential interaction and use caution when prescribing levofloxacin to patients taking warfarin .

HIV co - infection were studied : 15 chronic HBV mono - infected patients and 20 HBV - HIV co - infected patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The latter group was further sub - divided into 13 occult HBV ( HBsAg - negative ) and 7 overt HBV ( HBsAg - positive ) patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
HBsAg , anti - HBs , anti - HBc , and anti - HIV 1 / 2 were determined as part of routine diagnosis using Axsym assays ( Abbott Laboratories
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, North Chicago , IL ) .
O O O O O O O
Serum samples were PCR amplified with HBV reverse transcriptase ( RT ) primers , followed by direct sequencing across the tyrosine - methionine - aspartate - aspartate ( YMDD )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O B O O O
motif of the major catalytic region in the C domain of the HBV RT enzyme .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HBV viral load was performed with Amplicor HBV Monitor test v2 . 0 ( Roche Diagnostics , Penzberg , Germany ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HBV lamivudine - resistant strains were detected in 3 of 15 mono - infected chronic hepatitis B patients and 10 of 20 HBV - HIV co - infected patients .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To the best of our knowledge , this constitutes the first report of HBV lamivudine - resistant strains in therapy - na ve HBV - HIV co - infected patients
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
.
O
The HBV viral loads for mono - infected and co - infected patients ranged from 3 . 32 x 10 ( 2 ) to 3 . 82 x 10 (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
7 ) and < 200 to 4 . 40 x 10 ( 3 ) copies / ml , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It remains to be seen whether such pre - existing antiviral mutations could result in widespread emergence of HBV resistant strains when lamivudine - containing highly active antiretroviral ( ARV
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
) treatment ( HAART ) regimens become widely applied in South Africa , as this is likely to have potential implications in the management of HBV - HIV co -

Sex differences in NMDA antagonist enhancement of morphine antihyperalgesia in a capsaicin model of persistent pain : comparisons to two models of acute pain .
O O O B O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In acute pain models , N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) antagonists enhance the antinociceptive effects of morphine to a greater extent in males than females
O O O O O B I I I I I I O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
.
O
The purpose of this investigation was to extend these findings to a persistent pain model which could be distinguished from acute pain models on the basis of the nociceptive fibers
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
activated , neurochemical substrates , and duration of the nociceptive stimulus .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
To this end , persistent hyperalgesia was induced by administration of capsaicin in the tail of gonadally intact F344 rats , following which the tail was immersed in a mildly
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
noxious thermal stimulus , and tail - withdrawal latencies measured .
O O O O O O O O O O O
For comparison , tests were conducted in two acute pain models , the hotplate and warm water tail - withdrawal procedures .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In males , the non - competitive NMDA antagonist dextromethorphan enhanced the antihyperalgesic effect of low to moderate doses of morphine in a dose - and time - dependent manner
O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Across the doses and pretreatment times examined , enhancement was not observed in females .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Enhancement of morphine antinociception by dextromethorphan was seen in both males and females in the acute pain models , with the magnitude of this effect being greater in males .
O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings demonstrate a sexually - dimorphic interaction between NMDA antagonists and morphine in a persistent pain model that can be distinguished from those observed in acute pain models .

Development of proteinuria after switch to sirolimus - based immunosuppression in long - term cardiac transplant patients .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Calcineurin - inhibitor therapy can lead to renal dysfunction in heart transplantation patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The novel immunosuppressive ( IS ) drug sirolmus ( Srl ) lacks nephrotoxic effects ; however , proteinuria associated with Srl has been reported following renal transplantation .
O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
In cardiac transplantation , the incidence of proteinuria associated with Srl is unknown .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
In this study , long - term cardiac transplant patients were switched from cyclosporine to Srl - based IS .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O
Concomitant IS consisted of mycophenolate mofetil + / -
O O O O B I O O O
steroids .
B O
Proteinuria increased significantly from a median of 0 . 13 g / day ( range 0 - 5 . 7 ) preswitch to 0 . 23 g / day (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
0 - 9 . 88 ) at 24 months postswitch ( p = 0 . 0024 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Before the switch , 11 . 5 % of patients had high - grade proteinuria ( > 1 . 0 g / day ) ; this increased to 22 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
9 % postswitch ( p = 0 . 006 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O
ACE inhibitor and angiotensin - releasing blocker ( ARB ) therapy reduced proteinuria development .
B I O B I I I O B O O O O O O
Patients without proteinuria had increased renal function ( median 42 . 5 vs . 64 . 1 , p = 0 . 25 ) , whereas patients who developed high
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- grade proteinuria showed decreased renal function at the end of follow - up ( median 39 . 6 vs . 29 . 2 , p = 0 . 125
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) .
O O
Thus , proteinuria may develop in cardiac transplant patients after switch to Srl , which may have an adverse effect on renal function in these patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Srl should be used with ACEi / ARB therapy and patients monitored for proteinuria and increased renal dysfunction .

Methamphetamine - induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation are not mediated by fractalkine receptor signaling .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Methamphetamine ( METH ) damages dopamine ( DA ) nerve endings by a process that has been linked to microglial activation but the signaling pathways that mediate this response have

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O
Because the CNS damage caused by METH and MPTP is highly selective for the DA neuronal system in mouse models of neurotoxicity , we hypothesized that the CX3CR1 plays a
O O O O O O B O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
role in METH - induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation .
O O B O O O O O O O
Mice in which the CX3CR1 gene has been deleted and replaced with a cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein ( eGFP ) were treated with METH and examined for striatal
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
neurotoxicity .
O O
METH depleted DA , caused microglial activation , and increased body temperature in CX3CR1 knockout mice to the same extent and over the same time course seen in wild -
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
type controls .
O O O
The effects of METH in CX3CR1 knockout mice were not gender - dependent and did not extend beyond the striatum .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Striatal microglia expressing eGFP constitutively show morphological changes after METH that are characteristic of activation .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
This response was restricted to the striatum and contrasted sharply with unresponsive eGFP - microglia in surrounding brain areas that are not damaged by METH .

We conclude from these studies that CX3CR1 signaling does not modulate METH neurotoxicity or microglial activation .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Furthermore , it appears that striatal - resident microglia respond to METH with an activation cascade and then return to a surveying state without undergoing apoptosis or migration .

TAC has been shown to be a potent immunosuppressive agent for solid organ transplantation in pediatrics .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Neurotoxicity is a potentially serious toxic effect .
O O O O O O O O
It is characterized by encephalopathy , headaches , seizures , or neurological deficits .

Course following treatment modifications .
O O O O O
Valvular heart abnormalities have been reported in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) treated with pergolide .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
However , the incidence and severity of these abnormalities vary from study to study and their course after drug withdrawal has not been systematically assessed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVES :
O O
To estimate the frequency and severity of valvular heart abnormality and its possible reversibility after drug withdrawal in a case - control study .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
All PD patients in the Amiens area treated with pergolide were invited to attend a cardiologic assessment including transthoracic echocardiography .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Thirty PD patients participated in the study .
O O O O O O O O
A second echocardiography was performed ( median interval : 13 months ) after pergolide withdrawal ( n = 10 patients ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Controls were age - and sex - matched non - PD patients referred to the cardiology department .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Compared to controls , aortic regurgitation ( OR : 3 . 1 ; 95 % IC :
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 . 1 - 8 . 8 ) and mitral regurgitation ( OR : 10 . 7 ; 95 % IC : 2 . 1 - 53 ) were more
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
frequent in PD patients ( tricuspid : NS ) .
O O O O O O O O O O
The number of affected valves ( n = 2 . 4 + / - 0 . 7 ) and the sum of regurgitation grades ( n = 2 . 8
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
+ / - 1 . 09 ) were higher ( p = 0 . 008 and p = 0 . 006 , respectively ) in the pergolide group .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Severity of regurgitation was not correlated with pergolide cumulative dose .
O O O O O O O B O O O
A restrictive pattern of valvular regurgitation , suggestive of the role of pergolide , was observed in 12 / 30 ( 40 % ) patients including two with heart failure
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Pergolide was discontinued in 10 patients with valvular heart disease , resulting in a lower regurgitation grade ( p = 0 . 01 ) at the second transthoracic echocardiography and
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the two patients with heart failure returned to nearly normal clinical examination .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This study supports the high frequency of restrictive valve regurgitation in PD patients treated with pergolide and reveals that a significant improvement is usual when the treatment is converted to

Adverse effects of topical papaverine on auditory nerve function .
O O O O B O O O O O
BACKGROUND : Papaverine hydrochloride is a direct - acting vasodilator used to manage vasospasm during various neurosurgical operations .
O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Transient cranial nerve dysfunction has been described in a few cases with topical papaverine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
This study supports previous reports and provides neurophysiological evidence of an adverse effect on the auditory nerve .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
We conducted a retrospective review of 70 consecutive microvascular decompression operations and studied those patients who received topical papaverine for vasospasm .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Topical papaverine was used as a direct therapeutic action to manage vasospasm in a total of 11 patients .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The timing of papaverine application and ongoing operative events was reviewed relative to changes in neurophysiological recordings .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Brainstem auditory evoked potentials ( BAEPs ) were routinely used to monitor cochlear nerve function during these operations .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
FINDINGS :
O O
A temporal relationship was found between topical papaverine and BAEP changes leading to complete waveform loss .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
The average temporal delay between papaverine and the onset of an adverse BAEP change was 5 min .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 10 of 11 patients , BAEP waves II / III - V completely disappeared within 2 to 25 min after papaverine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Eight of these 10 patients had complete loss of BAEP waveforms within 10 min .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One patient showed no recovery of later waves and a delayed profound sensorineural hearing loss .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The average recovery time of BAEP waveforms to pre - papaverine baseline values was 39 min .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Topical papaverine for the treatment of vasospasm was associated with the onset of a transient disturbance in neurophysiological function of the ascending auditory brainstem pathway .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The complete disappearance of BAEP waveforms with a consistent temporal delay suggests a possible adverse effect on the proximal eighth nerve .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recommendations to avoid potential cranial nerve deficits from papaverine are provided .

Massive proteinuria and acute renal failure after oral bisphosphonate ( alendronate ) administration in a patient with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis .
O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
A 61 - year - old Japanese man with nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was initially responding well to steroid therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
The amount of daily urinary protein decreased from 15 . 6 to 2 . 8 g . Within 14 days of the oral bisphosphonate ( alendronate sodium ) administration ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I O O O
the amount of daily urinary protein increased rapidly up to 12 . 8 g with acute renal failure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After discontinuing the oral alendronate , the patient underwent six cycles of hemodialysis and four cycles of LDL apheresis .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Urinary volume and serum creatinine levels recovered to the normal range , with urinary protein disappearing completely within 40 days .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This report demonstrates that not only intravenous , but also oral bisphosphonates can aggravate proteinuria and acute renal failure .

Serum - and glucocorticoid - inducible kinase 1 in doxorubicin - induced nephrotic syndrome .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Doxorubicin - induced nephropathy leads to epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC ) - dependent volume retention and renal fibrosis .
B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
The aldosterone - sensitive serum - and glucocorticoid - inducible kinase SGK1 has been shown to participate in the stimulation of ENaC and to mediate renal fibrosis following mineralocorticoid and
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
salt excess .
O O O
The present study was performed to elucidate the role of SGK1 in the volume retention and fibrosis during nephrotic syndrome .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To this end , doxorubicin ( 15 mug / g body wt ) was injected intravenously into gene - targeted mice lacking SGK1 ( sgk1 ( - / - )
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) and their wild - type littermates ( sgk1 ( + / + ) ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Doxorubicin treatment resulted in heavy proteinuria ( > 100 mg protein / mg crea ) in 15 / 44 of sgk1 ( + / + ) and 15 / 44
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of sgk1 ( - / - ) mice leading to severe nephrotic syndrome with ascites , lipidemia , and hypoalbuminemia in both genotypes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Plasma aldosterone levels increased in nephrotic mice of both genotypes and was followed by increased SGK1 protein expression in sgk1 ( + / + ) mice .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Urinary sodium excretion reached signficantly lower values in sgk1 ( + / + ) mice ( 15 + / -

O O O O O O
During the course of nephrotic syndrome , serum urea concentrations increased significantly faster in sgk1 ( - / - ) mice than in sgk1 ( + / + ) mice
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
leading to uremia and a reduced median survival in sgk1 ( - / - ) mice ( 29 vs . 40 days in sgk1 ( + / + ) mice
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) .
O O
In conclusion , gene - targeted mice lacking SGK1 showed blunted volume retention , yet were not protected against renal fibrosis during experimental nephrotic syndrome .

Severe and long lasting cholestasis after high - dose co - trimoxazole treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV - infected patients - - a report of two cases .
O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pneumocystis pneumonia ( PCP ) , a common opportunistic infection in HIV - infected individuals , is generally treated with high doses of co - trimoxazole .

Clinically significant proteinuria following the administration of sirolimus to renal transplant recipients .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Sirolimus is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection , and may have less nephrotoxicity than calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) - based regimens .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant proteinuria linked with the use of sirolimus .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
We have encountered several patients who developed substantial proteinuria associated with sirolimus use .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
In each patient , the close temporal association between the commencement of sirolimus therapy and proteinuria implicated sirolimus as the most likely etiology of the proteinuria .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
We analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the Washington Hospital Center between 1999 - 2003 for whom sirolimus was a component of their
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
immunosuppressant regimen .
O O O
In these patients , the magnitude of proteinuria was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein : creatinine ratios , an estimate of grams of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
proteinuria / day .
O O O O
Laboratory results were compared between prior , during and following sirolimus use .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O
RESULTS :
O O
Twenty - eight patients ( 24 % ) developed increased proteinuria from baseline during their post - transplantation course .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 21 patients an alternative cause of proteinuria was either obvious or insufficient data was available to be conclusive .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of sirolimus and the development of nephrotic - range proteinuria .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Proteinuria correlated most strongly with sirolimus therapy when compared to other demographic and clinical variables .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
In most patients , discontinuation of sirolimus resulted in a decrease , but not resolution , of proteinuria .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Sirolimus induces or aggravates pre - existing proteinuria in an unpredictable subset of renal allograft recipients .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Proteinuria may improve , but does not resolve , when sirolimus is withdrawn .

Comparative cognitive and subjective side effects of immediate - release oxycodone in healthy middle - aged and older adults .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
This study measured the objective and subjective neurocognitive effects of a single 10 - mg dose of immediate - release oxycodone in healthy , older ( > 65 years )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
, and middle - aged ( 35 to 55 years ) adults who were not suffering from chronic or significant daily pain .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Seventy - one participants completed 2 separate study days and were blind to medication condition ( placebo , 10 - mg oxycodone ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Plasma oxycodone concentration peaked between 60 and 90 minutes postdose ( P < . 01 ) and pupil size , an indication of physiological effects of the medication , peaked
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at approximately 90 to 120 minutes postdose ( P < . 01 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Significant declines in simple and sustained attention , working memory , and verbal memory were observed at 1 hour postdose compared to baseline for both age groups with a trend
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
toward return to baseline by 5 hours postdose .
O O O O O O O O O
For almost all cognitive measures , there were no medication by age - interaction effects , which indicates that the 2 age groups exhibited similar responses to the medication challenge
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
This study suggests that for healthy older adults who are not suffering from chronic pain , neurocognitive and pharmacodynamic changes in response to a 10 - mg dose of immediate
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- release oxycodone are similar to those observed for middle - aged adults .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
PERSPECTIVE : Study findings indicate that the metabolism , neurocognitive effects , and physical side effects of oral oxycodone are similar for healthy middle - aged and older adults .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , clinicians should not avoid prescribing oral opioids to older adults based on the belief that older adults are at higher risk for side effects than younger adults .

Normalizing effects of modafinil on sleep in chronic cocaine users .
O O O B O O O O B O O
OBJECTIVE : The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of morning - dosed modafinil on sleep and daytime sleepiness in chronic cocaine users .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O
METHOD :
O O
Twenty cocaine - dependent participants were randomly assigned to receive modafinil , 400 mg ( N = 10 ) , or placebo ( N = 10 ) every morning at
O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
7 : 30 a . m . for 16 days in an inpatient , double - blind randomized trial .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Participants underwent polysomnographic sleep recordings on days 1 to 3 , 7 to 9 , and 14 to 16 ( first , second , and third weeks of abstinence )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
The Multiple Sleep Latency Test was performed at 11 : 30 a . m . , 2 : 00 p . m . , and 4 : 30 p .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
m . on days 2 , 8 , and 15 .
O O O O O O O O O O O
For comparison of sleep architecture variables , 12 healthy comparison participants underwent a single night of experimental polysomnography that followed 1 night of accommodation polysomnography .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Progressive abstinence from cocaine was associated with worsening of all measured polysomnographic sleep outcomes .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Compared with placebo , modafinil decreased nighttime sleep latency and increased slow - wave sleep time in cocaine - dependent participants .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The effect of modafinil interacted with the abstinence week and was associated with longer total sleep time and shorter REM sleep latency in the third week of abstinence .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Comparison of slow - wave sleep time , total sleep time , and sleep latency in cocaine - dependent and healthy participants revealed a normalizing effect of modafinil in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O
cocaine - dependent participants .
B O O O O
Modafinil was associated with increased daytime sleep latency , as measured by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test , and a nearly significant decrease in subjective daytime sleepiness .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Morning - dosed modafinil promotes nocturnal sleep , normalizes sleep architecture , and decreases daytime sleepiness in abstinent cocaine users .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
These effects may be relevant in the treatment of cocaine dependence .

Efficacy and safety of asenapine in a placebo - and haloperidol - controlled trial in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia .
O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Asenapine is approved by the Food and Drugs Administration in adults for acute treatment of schizophrenia or of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder with or without
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
psychotic features .
O O O
In a double - blind 6 - week trial , 458 patients with acute schizophrenia were randomly assigned to fixed - dose treatment with asenapine at 5 mg twice daily
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
( BID ) , asenapine at 10 mg BID , placebo , or haloperidol at 4 mg BID ( to verify assay sensitivity ) .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
With last observations carried forward ( LOCF ) , mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score reductions from baseline to endpoint were significantly greater with asenapine at 5 mg
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
BID ( - 16 . 2 ) and haloperidol ( - 15 . 4 ) than placebo ( - 10 . 7 ; both P < 0 . 05 )
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
;

using mixed model for repeated measures ( MMRM ) , changes at day 42 were significantly greater with asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID ( - 21 . 3
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
and - 19 . 4 , respectively ) and haloperidol ( - 20 . 0 ) than placebo ( - 14 . 6 ; all P < 0 . 05
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) .
O O
On the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive subscale , all treatments were superior to placebo with LOCF and MMRM ; asenapine at 5 mg BID was superior to placebo
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
on the negative subscale with MMRM and on the general psychopathology subscale with LOCF and MMRM .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Treatment - related adverse events ( AEs ) occurred in 44 % and 52 % , 57 % , and 41 % of the asenapine at 5 and 10 mg
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
BID , haloperidol , and placebo groups , respectively .
O O B O O O O O O O
Extrapyramidal symptoms reported as AEs occurred in 15 % and 18 % , 34 % , and 10 % of the asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID ,

haloperidol , and placebo groups , respectively .
B O O O O O O O
Across all groups , no more than 5 % of patients had clinically significant weight change .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Post hoc analyses indicated that efficacy was similar with asenapine and haloperidol ; greater contrasts were seen in AEs , especially extrapyramidal symptoms .

Permeability , ultrastructural changes , and distribution of novel proteins in the glomerular barrier in early puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O
BACKGROUND / AIMS :
O O O O
It is still unclear what happens in the glomerulus when proteinuria starts .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Using puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis ( PAN ) rats , we studied early ultrastructural and permeability changes in relation to the expression of the podocyte - associated molecules nephrin , a
O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- actinin , dendrin , and plekhh2 , the last two of which were only recently discovered in podocytes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Using immune stainings , semiquantitative measurement was performed under the electron microscope .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Permeability was assessed using isolated kidney perfusion with tracers .
O O O O O O O O O O
Possible effects of ACE inhibition were tested .
O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
By day 2 , some patchy foot process effacement , but no proteinuria , appeared .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The amount of nephrin was reduced in both diseased and normal areas .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The other proteins showed few changes , which were limited to diseased areas .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
By day 4 , foot process effacement was complete and proteinuria appeared in parallel with signs of size barrier damage .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nephrin decreased further , while dendrin and plekhh2 also decreased but a - actinin remained unchanged .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ACE inhibition had no significant protective effect .
O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
PAN glomeruli already showed significant pathology by day 4 , despite relatively mild proteinuria .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This was preceded by altered nephrin expression , supporting its pivotal role in podocyte morphology .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The novel proteins dendrin and plekhh2 were both reduced , suggesting roles in PAN , whereas a - actinin was unchanged .

Learning of rats under amnesia caused by pentobarbital .
O O O O O O O B O
Dissociated learning of rats in the normal state and the state of amnesia produced by pentobarbital ( 15 mg / kg , ip ) was carried out .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Rats were trained to approach a shelf where they received food reinforcement .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In Group 1 the rats were trained under the influence of pentobarbital to run to the same shelf as in the normal state .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
In Group 2 the rats were trained to approach different shelves in different drug states .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was shown that memory dissociation occurred in both groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Differences in the parameters of training under the influence of pentobarbital between Groups 1 and 2 were revealed .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
These findings show that the brain - dissociated state induced by pentobarbital is formed with the participation of the mechanisms of information perception .

Extrapyramidal side effects with risperidone and haloperidol at comparable D2 receptor occupancy levels .
O O O O B O B O O O O O O O
Risperidone is an antipsychotic drug with high affinity at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5 - HT2 receptors .
B O O O O O O O O B O O B I I I O O
Previous clinical studies have proposed that risperidone 's pharmacologic profile may produce improved efficacy for negative psychotic symptoms and decreased propensity for extrapyramidal side effects ; features shared by so
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- called ' atypical ' neuroleptics .
O O O O O O O
To determine if routine risperidone treatment is associated with a unique degree of D2 receptor occupancy and pattern of clinical effects , we used [ 123I ] IBZM SPECT to
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
determine D2 occupancy in subjects treated with routine clinical doses of risperidone ( n = 12 ) or haloperidol ( n = 7 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Both risperidone and haloperidol produced D2 occupancy levels between approximately 60 and 90 % at standard clinical doses .
O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was no significant difference between occupancy levels obtained with haloperidol or risperidone .
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
Drug - induced parkinsonism was observed in subjects treated with risperidone ( 42 % ) and haloperidol ( 29 % ) and was observed at occupancy levels above 60 %
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Based on these observations , it is concluded that 5 - HT2 blockade obtained with risperidone at D2 occupancy rates of 60 % and above does not appear to protect
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
against the risk for extrapyramidal side effects .

Simvastatin - ezetimibe - induced hepatic failure necessitating liver transplantation .
B I I O O O O O O O O
Abstract Serum aminotransferase elevations are a commonly known adverse effect of 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor ( statin ) therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
However , hepatotoxic events have not been widely published with ezetimibe or the combination agent simvastatin - ezetimibe .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B I I O
We describe a 70 - year - old Hispanic woman who developed fulminant hepatic failure necessitating liver transplantation 10 weeks after conversion from simvastatin 40 mg / day to
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
simvastatin 10 mg - ezetimibe 40 mg / day .
B I I I I I I O O O
The patient 's lipid panel had been maintained with simvastatin for 18 months before the conversion without evidence of hepatotoxicity .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
A routine laboratory work - up 10 weeks after conversion revealed elevated serum aminotransferase levels .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Simvastatinezetimibe and escitalopram ( which she was taking for depression ) were discontinued , and other potential causes of hepatotoxicity were excluded .
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A repeat work - up revealed further elevations in aminotransferase levels , and liver biopsy revealed evidence of moderate - to - severe drug toxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She underwent liver transplantation with an uneventful postoperative course .
O O O O O O O O O O
Her aminotransferase levels returned to normal by postoperative day 23 , and her 2 - year follow - up showed no adverse events .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ezetimibe undergoes extensive glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucoronosyltransferases ( UGT ) in the intestine and liver and may have inhibited the glucuronidation of simvastatin hydroxy acid , resulting in increased
B O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O
simvastatin exposure and subsequent hepatotoxicity .
B O O O O O
To our knowledge , this is the first case report of simvastatin - ezetimibe - induced liver failure that resulted in liver transplantation .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
We postulate that the mechanism of the simvastatinezetimibe - induced hepatotoxicity is the increased simvastatin exposure by ezetimibe inhibition of UGT enzymes .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O
Clinicians should be aware of potential hepatotoxicity with simvastatin - ezetimibe especially in elderly patients and should carefully monitor serum aminotransferase levels when starting therapy and titrating the dosage .

The aim of the documentation of this clinical case is to make clinicians aware of """" meth mouth """" and the medical risks associated with this serious condition .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Methamphetamine is a very addictive , powerful stimulant that increases wakefulness and physical activity and can produce other effects such as cardiac dysrhythmias , hypertension , hallucinations , and violent
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
behavior .
O O
Dental patients abusing methamphetamine can present with poor oral hygiene , xerostomia , rampant caries ( """" meth mouth """" ) , and excessive tooth wear .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Oral rehabilitation of patients using methamphetamine can be challenging .
O O O O O B O O O O
CASE DESCRIPTION :
O O O
A 30 - year - old Caucasian woman presented with dental pain , bad breath , and self - reported poor esthetics .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A comprehensive examination including her medical history , panoramic radiograph , and intraoral examination revealed 19 carious lesions , which is not very common for a healthy adult .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She reported her use of methamphetamine for five years and had not experienced any major carious episodes before she started using the drug .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
SUMMARY :
O O
The patient 's medical and dental histories along with radiographic and clinical findings lead to a diagnosis of """" meth mouth . """"
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although three different dental treatment modalities ( either conventional or implant - supported ) have been offered to the patient since August 2007 , the patient has yet to initiate

CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE :
O O O
This clinical case showing oral manifestations of meth mouth was presented to help dental practitioners recognize and manage patients who may be abusing methamphetamines .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Dental practitioners also may be skeptical about the reliability of appointment keeping by these patients , as they frequently miss their appointments without reasonable justification .

Thyroxine abuse : an unusual case of thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy .
B O O O O O O O O O O
Eating disorders and the associated behavioural problems and drug abuse are uncommon in pregnancy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When they do occur they are often unrecognized because of denial but when significant may pose a risk to both the mother and her fetus .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This case illustrates a number of problems that may be encountered in women with eating disorders in pregnancy , including prolonged and recurrent metabolic disturbances and diuretic abuse .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In particular it illustrates the derangements of thyroid function seen in pregnant women with eating disorders and reminds us that when a cause for thyrotoxicosis remains obscure , thyroxine abuse
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
should be considered and explored .

Attenuation of methamphetamine - induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice by lipopolysaccharide pretreatment .
O O B O O O O O O O O B O O
Immunological activation has been proposed to play a role in methamphetamine - induced dopaminergic terminal damage .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
In this study , we examined the roles of lipopolysaccharide , a pro - inflammatory and inflammatory factor , treatment in modulating the methamphetamine - induced nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O
Lipopolysaccharide pretreatment did not affect the basal body temperature or methamphetamine - elicited hyperthermia three days later .
B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Such systemic lipopolysaccharide treatment mitigated methamphetamine - induced striatal dopamine and 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in a dose - dependent manner .
O O B O O B O O O B O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O
As the most potent dose ( 1 mg / kg ) of lipopolysaccharide was administered two weeks , one day before or after the methamphetamine dosing regimen , methamphetamine -
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O
induced striatal dopamine and 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions remained unaltered .
O O B O B I I I I I O O O O
Moreover , systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment ( 1 mg / kg ) attenuated local methamphetamine infusion - produced dopamine and 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in the striatum ,
O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O B I I I I I O O O O O
indicating that the protective effect of lipopolysaccharide is less likely due to interrupted peripheral distribution or metabolism of methamphetamine .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O
We concluded a critical time window for systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment in exerting effective protection against methamphetamine - induced nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity .

Butyrylcholinesterase gene mutations in patients with prolonged apnea after succinylcholine for electroconvulsive therapy .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
BACKGROUND : patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) often receive succinylcholine as part of the anesthetic procedure .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The duration of action may be prolonged in patients with genetic variants of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme ( BChE ) , the most common being the K - and the A
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- variants .
O O O
The aim of the study was to assess the clinical significance of genetic variants in butyrylcholinesterase gene ( BCHE ) in patients with a suspected prolonged duration of action of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
succinylcholine after ECT .
B O O O
METHODS :
O O
a total of 13 patients were referred to the Danish Cholinesterase Research Unit after ECT during 38 months .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We determined the BChE activity and the BCHE genotype using molecular genetic methods , the duration of apnea , time to sufficient spontaneous ventilation and whether neuromuscular monitoring was used
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
The duration of apnea was compared with published data on normal subjects .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
in 11 patients , mutations were found in the BCHE gene , the K - variant being the most frequent .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The duration of apnea was 5 - 15 min compared with 3 - 5 . 3 min from the literature .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Severe distress was noted in the recovery phase in two patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Neuromuscular monitoring was used in two patients .
O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION : eleven of 13 patients with a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B
had mutations in BCHE , indicating that this is the possible reason for a prolonged period of apnea .

Ketamine sedation for the reduction of children 's fractures in the emergency department .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
There recently has been a resurgence in the utilization of ketamine , a unique anesthetic , for emergency - department procedures requiring sedation .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The purpose of the present study was to examine the safety and efficacy of ketamine for sedation in the treatment of children 's fractures in the emergency department .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
One hundred and fourteen children ( average age , 5 . 3 years ; range , twelve months to ten years and ten months ) who underwent closed reduction of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
an isolated fracture or dislocation in the emergency department at a level - I trauma center were prospectively evaluated .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ketamine hydrochloride was administered intravenously ( at a dose of two milligrams per kilogram of body weight ) in ninety - nine of the patients and intramuscularly ( at a
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dose of four milligrams per kilogram of body weight ) in the other fifteen .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A board - certified emergency physician skilled in airway management supervised administration of the anesthetic , and the patients were monitored by a registered nurse .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Any pain during the reduction was rated by the orthopaedic surgeon treating the patient according to the Children 's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale ( CHEOPS ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The average time from intravenous administration of ketamine to manipulation of the fracture or dislocation was one minute and thirty - six seconds ( range , twenty seconds to five
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
minutes ) , and the average time from intramuscular administration to manipulation was four minutes and forty - two seconds ( range , sixty seconds to fifteen minutes ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The average score according to the Children 's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale was 6 . 4 points ( range , 5 to 10 points ) , reflecting minimal
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
or no pain during fracture reduction .
O O O O O O O
Adequate fracture reduction was obtained in 111 of the children .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Ninety - nine percent ( sixty - eight ) of the sixty - nine parents present during the reduction were pleased with the sedation and would allow it to be
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
used again in a similar situation .
O O O O O O O
Patency of the airway and independent respiration were maintained in all of the patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Blood pressure and heart rate remained stable .
O O O O O O O O
Minor side effects included nausea ( thirteen patients ) , emesis ( eight of the thirteen patients with nausea ) , clumsiness ( evident as ataxic movements in ten patients
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) , and dysphoric reaction ( one patient ) .
O O O O O O O O O O
No long - term sequelae were noted , and no patients had hallucinations or nightmares .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Ketamine reliably , safely , and quickly provided adequate sedation to effectively facilitate the reduction of children 's fractures in the emergency department at our institution .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ketamine should only be used in an environment such as the emergency department , where proper one - on - one monitoring is used and board - certified physicians skilled
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in airway management are directly involved in the care of the patient .

Prophylactic use of lamivudine with chronic immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatologic disorders .
O O O B O O O O O O O O
The objective of this study was to report our experience concerning the effectiveness of the prophylactic administration of lamivudine in hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBs Ag ) positive
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I I I O B I O O
patients with rheumatologic disease .
O O O O O
From June 2004 to October 2006 , 11 HBs Ag positive patients with rheumatologic diseases , who were on both immunosuppressive and prophylactic lamivudine therapies , were retrospectively assessed .
O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Liver function tests , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) serologic markers , and HBV DNA levels of the patients during follow - up were obtained from hospital file records
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Eleven patients ( six male ) with median age 47 years ( range 27 - 73 ) , median disease duration 50 months ( range 9 - 178 ) and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
median follow - up period of patients 13 . 8 months ( range 5 - 27 ) were enrolled in this study .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lamivudine therapy was started 3 - 7 days prior to immunosuppressive therapy in all patients .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Baseline , liver function tests were elevated in two patients ( fourth patient : ALT : 122 IU / l , AST : 111 IU / l , tenth patient

/ l , with minimal changes in the liver biopsy in both ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Shortly after treatment their tests normalized and during follow - up period none of the patients had abnormal liver function tests .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In four patients HBV DNA levels were higher than normal at baseline .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two of these normalized and the others increased later .
O O O O O O O O O O
In three additional patients , HBV DNA levels were increased during follow - up .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
None of the patients had significant clinical sings of HBV activation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lamivudine was well tolerated and was continued in all patients .
B O O O O O O O O O O
Prophylactic administration of lamivudine in patients who required immunosuppressive therapy seems to be safe , well tolerated and effective in preventing HBV reactivation .

All patients ( 65 + / - 16 yrs ; 58 % males ) finished the examination .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mean doses of MZ and FL were 4 . 3 + / - 1 . 9 mg and 0 . 28 + / - 0 . 2 mg ,

airway obstruction by probe introduction and 8 ( 5 . 8 % ) due to hypoxia caused by MZ use .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Transient hypotension ( SAP < 90mmHg ) occurred in 1 patient ( 0 . 7 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The multivariate analysis showed that severe MR , MP ( EF < 45 % ) and high doses of MZ ( > 5 mg ) were associated with events (

Selegiline - induced postural hypotension in Parkinson 's disease : a longitudinal study on the effects of drug withdrawal .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVES :
O O
The United Kingdom Parkinson 's Disease Research Group ( UKPDRG ) trial found an increased mortality in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) randomized to receive 10 mg
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
selegiline per day and L - dopa compared with those taking L - dopa alone .
B O O O B I I O O O O B I I O O
Recently , we found that therapy with selegiline and L - dopa was associated with selective systolic orthostatic hypotension which was abolished by withdrawal of selegiline .
O O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
This unwanted effect on postural blood pressure was not the result of underlying autonomic failure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
selegiline in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes orthostatic hypotension .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
The cardiovascular responses to standing and head - up tilt were studied repeatedly in PD patients receiving selegiline and as the drug was withdrawn .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Head - up tilt caused systolic orthostatic hypotension which was marked in six of 20 PD patients on selegiline , one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
A lesser degree of orthostatic hypotension occurred with standing .
O O O O O O O O O O
Orthostatic hypotension was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of selegiline and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the drug .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Stopping selegiline also significantly reduced the supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
This study confirms our previous finding that selegiline in combination with L - dopa is associated with selective orthostatic hypotension .
O O O O O O O B O O O B I I O O O O O O O
The possibilities that these cardiovascular findings might be the result of non - selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase or of amphetamine and metamphetamine are discussed .

Explicit episodic memory for sensory - discriminative components of capsaicin - induced pain : immediate and delayed ratings .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Pain memory is thought to affect future pain sensitivity and thus contribute to clinical pain conditions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Systematic investigations of the human capacity to remember sensory features of experimental pain are sparse .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In order to address long - term pain memory , nine healthy male volunteers received intradermal injections of three doses of capsaicin ( 0 . 05 , 1 and 20
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
microg , separated by 15 min breaks ) , each given three times in a balanced design across three sessions at one week intervals .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pain rating was performed using a computerized visual analogue scale ( 0 - 100 ) digitized at 1 / s , either immediately online or one hour or one day
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after injection .
O O O
Subjects also recalled their pains one week later .
O O O O O O O O O
Capsaicin injection reliably induced a dose - dependent flare ( p < 0 . 001 ) without any difference within or across sessions .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The strong burning pain decayed exponentially within a few minutes .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Subjects were able to reliably discriminate pain magnitude and duration across capsaicin doses ( both p < 0 . 001 ) , regardless of whether first - time ratings were
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
requested immediately , after one hour or after one day .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Pain recall after one week was similarly precise ( magnitude : p < 0 . 01 , duration : p < 0 . 05 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Correlation with rating recall after one week was best when first - time ratings were requested as late as one day after injection ( R ( 2 ) = 0
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
. 79 ) indicating that both rating retrievals utilized similar memory traces .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results indicate a reliable memory for magnitude and duration of experimentally induced pain .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The data further suggest that the consolidation of this memory is an important interim stage , and may take up to one day .

Reversibility of captopril - induced renal insufficiency after prolonged use in an unusual case of renovascular hypertension .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We report a case of severe hypertension with an occluded renal artery to a solitary kidney , who developed sudden deterioration of renal function following treatment with captopril .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
His renal function remained impaired but stable during 2 years ' treatment with captopril but returned to pre - treatment levels soon after cessation of the drug .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This indicates reversibility in captopril - induced renal failure even after its prolonged use and suggests that no organic damage occurs to glomerular arterioles following chronic ACE inhibition .

Capsaicin - induced muscle pain alters the excitability of the human jaw - stretch reflex .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The pathophysiology of painful temporomandibular disorders is not fully understood , but evidence suggests that muscle pain modulates motor function in characteristic ways .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This study tested the hypothesis that activation of nociceptive muscle afferent fibers would be linked to an increased excitability of the human jaw - stretch reflex and whether this process
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
would be sensitive to length and velocity of the stretch .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Capsaicin ( 10 micro g ) was injected into the masseter muscle to induce pain in 11 healthy volunteers .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Short - latency reflex responses were evoked in the masseter and temporalis muscles by a stretch device with different velocities and displacements before , during , and after the pain
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
The normalized reflex amplitude increased with an increase in velocity at a given displacement , but remained constant with different displacements at a given velocity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The normalized reflex amplitude was significantly higher during pain , but only at faster stretches in the painful muscle .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Increased sensitivity of the fusimotor system during acute muscle pain could be one likely mechanism to explain the findings .

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for levodopa - induced dyskinesias in Parkinson 's disease .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
In a placebo - controlled , single - blinded , crossover study , we assessed the effect of """" real """" repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) versus """"
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sham """" rTMS ( placebo ) on peak dose dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ten patients with PD and prominent dyskinesias had rTMS ( 1 , 800 pulses ; 1 Hz rate ) delivered over the motor cortex for 4 consecutive days twice ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once real stimuli and once sham stimulation were used ; evaluations were done at the baseline and 1 day after the end of each of the treatment series .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Direct comparison between sham and real rTMS effects showed no significant difference in clinician - assessed dyskinesia severity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , comparison with the baseline showed small but significant reduction in dyskinesia severity following real rTMS but not placebo .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The major effect was on dystonia subscore .
O O O O O O O O
Similarly , in patient diaries , although both treatments caused reduction in subjective dyskinesia scores during the days of intervention , the effect was sustained for 3 days after the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
intervention for the real rTMS only .
O O O O O O O
Following rTMS , no side effects and no adverse effects on motor function and PD symptoms were noted .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results suggest the existence of residual beneficial clinical aftereffects of consecutive daily applications of low - frequency rTMS on dyskinesias in PD .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The effects may be further exploited for potential therapeutic uses .

Hydrogen cyanamide is a plant growth regulator used in agriculture to induce bud break in fruit trees .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Contact with the skin can result in percutaneous absorption of the substance that inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and can induce acetaldehyde syndrome in case of alcohol use .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O B O O
The purpose of this report is to describe two cases of a disulfiram - like syndrome following occupational exposure to hydrogen cyanamide .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I O
The first case involved a 59 - year - old man who used Dormex , which contains hydrogen cyanamide , without protection after consuming a large amount of alcohol during
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B I O O O O O O O O O B O
a meal .
O O O
In less than 1 hour after the ingestion of alcohol , he developed malaise with flushing of the face , tachycardia , and dyspnea .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Manifestations regressed spontaneously under surveillance in the hospital .
O O O O O O O O O
The second case occurred in a 55 - year - old farmer following cutaneous contact with Dormex .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Five hours after exposure , he developed disulfiram - like syndrome with flushing , tachycardia , and arterial hypotension after consuming three glasses of wine .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient recovered spontaneously in 3 hours under surveillance in the hospital .

Repeated trimipramine induces dopamine D2 / D3 and alpha1 - adrenergic up - regulation .
O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Trimipramine ( TRI ) , which shows a clinical antidepressant activity , is chemically related to imipramine but does not inhibit the reuptake of noradrenaline and 5 - hydroxytryptamine ,
B O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O B I I O
nor does it induce beta - adrenergic down - regulation .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The mechanism of its antidepressant activity is still unknown .
O O O O B O O O O O
The aim of the present study was to find out whether TRI given repeatedly was able to induce adaptive changes in the dopaminergic and alpha1 - adrenergic systems , demonstrated
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by us previously for various antidepressants .
O O O O O B O
TRI was given to male Wistar rats and male Albino Swiss mice perorally twice daily for 14 days .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the acute experiment TRI ( given i . p . ) does not antagonize the reserpine hypothermia in mice and does not potentiate the 5 - hydroxytryptophan head twitches
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I O O
in rats .
O O O
TRI given repeatedly to rats increases the locomotor hyperactivity induced by d - amphetamine , quinpirole and ( + ) - 7 - hydroxy - dipropyloaminotetralin ( dopamine D2 and
B O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
D3 effects ) .
O O O O
The stereotypies induced by d - amphetamine or apomorphine are not potentiated by TRI .
O O O O B I I O B O O O O B O
It increases the behaviour stimulation evoked by phenylephrine ( given intraventricularly ) in rats , evaluated in the open field test as well as the aggressiveness evoked by clonidine in
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
mice , both these effects being mediated by an alpha1 - adrenergic receptor .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It may be concluded that , like other tricyclic antidepressants studied previously , TRI given repeatedly increases the responsiveness of brain dopamine D2 and D3 ( locomotor activity but not
O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
stereotypy ) as well as alpha1 - adrenergic receptors to their agonists .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A question arises whether the reuptake inhibition is of any importance to the adaptive changes induced by repeated antidepressants , suggested to be responsible for the antidepressant activity .

Is the treatment of scabies hazardous ?
O O O O O O O
Treatment for scabies is usually initiated by general practitioners ; most consider lindane ( gamma benzene hexachloride ) the treatment of choice .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O O
Lindane is also widely used as an agricultural and industrial pesticide , and as a result the toxic profile of this insecticide is well understood .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Evidence is accumulating that lindane can be toxic to the central nervous system and may be associated with aplastic anaemia .

INTRODUCTION :
O O
Many substances that form methemoglobin ( MHb ) effectively counter cyanide ( CN ) toxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although MHb formers are generally applied as treatments for CN poisoning , it has been proposed that a stable , long - acting MHb former could serve as a CN
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pretreatment .
O O
Using this rationale , the 8 - aminoquinoline WR242511 , a potent long - lasting MHb former in rodents and beagle dogs , was studied in the rhesus monkey for
O O O O O B I I B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
advanced development as a potential CN pretreatment .
O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
In this study , WR242511 was administered intravenously ( IV ) in 2 female and 4 male rhesus monkeys in doses of 3 . 5 and / or 7 .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
0 mg / kg ; a single male also received WR242511 orally ( PO ) at 7 . 0 mg / kg .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Health status and MHb levels were monitored following exposure .
O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The selected doses of WR242511 , which produced significant methemoglobinemia in beagle dogs in earlier studies conducted elsewhere , produced very little MHb ( mean < 2 . 0 %
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) in the rhesus monkey .
O O O O O O
Furthermore , transient hemoglobinuria was noted approximately 60 minutes postinjection of WR242511 ( 3 . 5 or 7 . 0 mg / kg ) , and 2 lethalities occurred (
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one IV and one PO ) following the 7 . 0 mg / kg dose .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Myoglobinuria was also observed following the 7 . 0 mg / kg dose .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Histopathology analyses in the 2 animals that died revealed liver and kidney toxicity , with greater severity in the orally - treated animal .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
These data demonstrate direct and / or indirect drug - induced toxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is concluded that WR242511 should not be pursued as a pretreatment for CN poisoning unless the anti - CN characteristics of this compound can be successfully dissociated from those
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Neuroplasticity of the adult primate auditory cortex following cochlear hearing loss .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Tonotopic organization is an essential feature of the primary auditory area ( A1 ) of primate cortex .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In A1 of macaque monkeys , low frequencies are represented rostrolaterally and high frequencies are represented caudomedially .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The purpose of this study was to determine if changes occur in this tonotopic organization following cochlear hearing loss .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Under anesthesia , the superior temporal gyrus of adult macaque monkeys was exposed , and the tonotopic organization of A1 was mapped using conventional microelectrode recording techniques .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Following recovery , the monkeys were selectively deafened for high frequencies using kanamycin and furosemide .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
The actual frequencies deafened were determined by the loss of tone - burst elicited auditory brainstem responses .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Three months after deafening , A1 was remapped .
O O O O O O O O O
Postmortem cytoarchitectural features identifying A1 were correlated with the electrophysiologic data .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results indicate that the deprived area of A1 undergoes extensive reorganization and becomes responsive to intact cochlear frequencies .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The region of cortex that represents the low frequencies was not obviously affected by the cochlear hearing loss .

Atypical sensations following the use of subcutaneous sumatriptan are common , but of uncertain origin .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
They are almost always benign , but can be mistaken for a serious adverse event by the patient .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two patients are presented with tingling or burning sensations limited to areas of heat exposure or sunburn .

Tremor side effects of salbutamol , quantified by a laser pointer technique .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To study tremor side effects of salbutamol an easily applicable , quick and low - priced method is needed .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A new method using a commercially available , pen - shaped laser pointer was developed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Aim of the study was to determine sensitivity , reproducibility , reference values and the agreement with a questionnaire .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Tremor was measured using a laser pointer technique .
O O O O O O O O O
To determine sensitivity we assessed tremor in 44 patients with obstructive lung disease after administration of cumulative doses of salbutamol .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Subjects were asked to aim at the centre of a target , subdivided in concentric circles , from 5 m distance .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The circle in which the participant succeeded to aim was recorded in millimetres radius .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In another series of measurements , reproducibility and reference values of the tremor was assessed in 65 healthy subjects in three sessions , at 9 a . m . ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 p . m . and 9 a . m . , respectively , 1 week later .

Postural tremor was measured with the arm horizontally outstretched rest tremor with the arm supported by an armrest and finally tremor was measured after holding a 2 - kg weight
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
until exhaustion .
O O O
Inter - observer variability was measured in a series of 10 healthy subjects .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Tremor was measured simultaneously by two independent observers .
O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Salbutamol significantly increased tremor severity in patients in a dose - dependent way .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Within healthy adults no age - dependency could be found ( b = 0 . 262 mm / year ; P = 0 . 72 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was no agreement between the questionnaire and tremor severity ( r = 0 . 093 ; P = 0 . 53 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Postural tremor showed no significant difference between the first and third session ( P = 0 . 07 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Support of the arm decreased tremor severity , exhaustion increased tremor severity significantly .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A good agreement was found between two independent observers ( interclass correlation coefficient 0 . 72 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DISCUSSION :
O O
Quantifying tremor by using an inexpensive laser pointer is , with the exception of children ( < 12 years ) a sensitive and reproducible method .

O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
STUDY OBJECTIVE :
O O O
To evaluate the frequency of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) in patients with advanced androgen - independent prostate cancer who were treated with docetaxel alone or in combination with
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
thalidomide .
B O
DESIGN :
O O
Retrospective analysis of a randomized phase II trial .
O O O O O O O O O
SETTING : National Institutes of Health clinical research center .
O O O O O O O O O O
PATIENTS :
O O
Seventy men , aged 50 - 80 years , with advanced androgen - independent prostate cancer .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
INTERVENTION :
O O
Each patient received either intravenous docetaxel 30 mg / m2 / week for 3 consecutive weeks , followed by 1 week off , or the combination of continuous oral
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
thalidomide 200 mg every evening plus the same docetaxel regimen .
B O O O O O O O B O O
This 4 - week cycle was repeated until there was evidence of excessive toxicity or disease progression .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS :
O O O O O
None of 23 patients who received docetaxel alone developed VTE , whereas 9 of 47 patients ( 19 % ) who received docetaxel plus thalidomide developed VTE ( p =
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
0 . 025 ) .
O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
The addition of thalidomide to docetaxel in the treatment of prostate cancer significantly increases the frequency of VTE .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinicians should be aware of this potential complication when adding thalidomide to chemotherapeutic regimens .

Sublingual absorption of the quaternary ammonium antiarrhythmic agent , UM - 272 . UM - 272 ( N , N - dimethylpropranolol ) , a quaternary antiarrhythmic agent , was
O O O O B I O O O B I I O B I I O B I I I I O O O O O O O O
administered sublingually to dogs with ouabain - induced ventricular tachycardias .
O O O O O B O O O O O
Both anti - arrhythmic efficacy and bioavailability were compared to oral drug .

Sublingual UM - 272 converted ventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm in all 5 dogs .
O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
The area under the plasma concentration time curve at 90 min was 4 - 12 times greater than for oral drug , suggesting the existence of an absorption - limiting

Severe thrombocytopenia and haemolytic anaemia associated with ciprofloxacin : a case report with fatal outcome .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Haematological adverse reactions associated with fatal outcome are rare during treatment with ciprofloxacin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
A 30 - year old Caucasian man reported with abdominal pain and jaundice after 3 - day administration of oral ciprofloxacin for a suspect of urinary tract infection .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Clinical evaluations suggested an initial diagnosis of severe thrombocytopenia and haemolysis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient progressively developed petechiae and purpura on thorax and lower limbs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Despite pharmacological and supportive interventions , laboratory parameters worsened and the patient died 17 hours after admission .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An accurate autopsy revealed most organs with diffuse petechial haemorrhages .
O O O O O O O O O O O
No signs of bone marrow depression were found .
O O O O O O O O O
No thrombi or signs of microangiopathies were observed in arterial vessels .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Blood and urine cultures did not show any bacterial growth .
O O O O O O O O O O O
This case report shows that ciprofloxacin may precipitate life - threatening thrombocytopenia and haemolytic anaemia , even in the early phases of treatment and without apparent previous exposures .

A 54 - year - old hypothyroid male taking thyroxine and simvastatin presented with bilateral leg compartment syndrome and myonecrosis .
O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O
Urgent fasciotomies were performed and the patient made an uneventful recovery with the withdrawal of simvastatin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
It is likely that this complication will be seen more often with the increased worldwide use of this drug and its approval for all arteriopathic patients .

We report a case of bile duct hamartoma which developed in a patient who had been on long - term danazol treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Such patients should be under close follow - up , preferably with periodic ultrasound examination of the liver .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If the patient develops a liver mass , because of non - specific clinical features and imaging appearances , biopsy may be the only way to achieve a definitive diagnosis

Granulomatous hepatitis due to combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid .
O O O O B I I I I I O
We report the case of a patient with amoxicillin - clavulanic acid - induced hepatitis with histologic multiple granulomas .
O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O
This type of lesion broadens the spectrum of liver injury due to this drug combination , mainly represented by a benign cholestatic syndrome .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The association of granulomas and eosinophilia favor an immunoallergic mechanism .
O O O O O O O O O O O
As penicillin derivatives and amoxicillin alone are known to induce such types of lesions , the amoxicillin component , with or without a potentiating effect of clavulanic acid , might
O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I O O
have a major role .

Intracranial aneurysms and cocaine abuse : analysis of prognostic indicators .
O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE : The outcome of subarachnoid hemorrhage associated with cocaine abuse is reportedly poor .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , no study in the literature has reported the use of a statistical model to analyze the variables that influence outcome .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
A review of admissions during a 6 - year period revealed 14 patients with cocaine - related aneurysms .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
This group was compared with a control group of 135 patients with ruptured aneurysms and no history of cocaine abuse .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Age at presentation , time of ictus after intoxication , Hunt and Hess grade of subarachnoid hemorrhage , size of the aneurysm , location of the aneurysm , and the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Glasgow Outcome Scale score were assessed and compared .
O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The patients in the study group were significantly younger than the patients in the control group ( P < 0 . 002 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In patients in the study group , all aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The majority of these aneurysms were smaller than those of the control group ( 8 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
6 . 08 mm versus 11 + / -
O O O O O O O O O
5 . 4 mm ; P = 0 . 05 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The differences in mortality and morbidity between the two groups were not significant .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hunt and Hess grade ( P < 0 . 005 ) and age ( P < 0 . 007 ) were significant predictors of outcome for the patients with
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cocaine - related aneurysms .
B O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Cocaine use predisposed aneurysmal rupture at a significantly earlier age and in much smaller aneurysms .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Contrary to the published literature , this group did reasonably well with aggressive management .

Anti - epileptic drugs - induced de novo absence seizures .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The authors present three patients with de novo absence epilepsy after administration of carbamazepine and vigabatrin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
Despite the underlying diseases , the prognosis for drug - induced de novo absence seizure is good because it subsides rapidly after discontinuing the use of the offending drugs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The gamma - aminobutyric acid - transmitted thalamocortical circuitry accounts for a major part of the underlying neurophysiology of the absence epilepsy .
O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because drug - induced de novo absence seizure is rare , pro - absence drugs can only be considered a promoting factor .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The underlying epileptogenecity of the patients or the synergistic effects of the accompanying drugs is required to trigger the de novo absence seizure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The possibility of drug - induced aggravation should be considered whenever an unexpected increase in seizure frequency and / or new seizure types appear following a change in drug treatment
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
By understanding the underlying mechanism of absence epilepsy , we can avoid the inappropriate use of anticonvulsants in children with epilepsy and prevent drug - induced absence seizures .

Procainamide - induced polymorphous ventricular tachycardia .
B O O O O O O
Seven cases of procainamide - induced polymorphous ventricular tachycardia are presented .
O O O B O O O O O O O O
In four patients , polymorphous ventricular tachycardia appeared after intravenous administration of 200 to 400 mg of procainamide for the treatment of sustained ventricular tachycardia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
In the remaining three patients , procainamide was administered orally for treatment of chronic premature ventricular contractions or atrial flutter .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These patients had Q - T prolongation and recurrent syncope due to polymorphous ventricular tachycardia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In four patients , the arrhythmia was rapidly diagnosed and treated with disappearance of further episodes of the arrhythmia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In two patients , the arrhythmia degenerated into irreversible ventricular fibrillation and both patients died .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the seventh patient , a permanent ventricular pacemaker was inserted and , despite continuation of procainamide therapy , polymorphous ventricular tachycardia did not reoccur .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
These seven cases demonstrate that procainamide can produce an acquired prolonged Q - T syndrome with polymorphous ventricular tachycardia .

Role of activation of bradykinin B2 receptors in disruption of the blood - brain barrier during acute hypertension .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cellular mechanisms which account for disruption the blood - brain barrier during acute hypertension are not clear .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The goal of this study was to determine the role of synthesis / release of bradykinin to activate B2 receptors in disruption of the blood - brain barrier during acute
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hypertension .
O O
Permeability of the blood - brain barrier was quantitated by clearance of fluorescent - labeled dextran before and during phenylephrine - induced acute hypertension in rats treated with vehicle and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Hoe - 140 ( 0 . 1 microM ) .
B I I O O O O O O O
Phenylephrine infusion increased arterial pressure , arteriolar diameter and clearance of fluorescent dextran by a similar magnitude in both groups .
B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
These findings suggest that disruption of the blood - brain barrier during acute hypertension is not related to the synthesis / release of bradykinin to activate B2 receptors .

5 - azacytidine potentiates initiation induced by carcinogens in rat liver .
B I I O O O O O O O O O
To test the validity of the hypothesis that hypomethylation of DNA plays an important role in the initiation of carcinogenic process , 5 - azacytidine ( 5 - AzC )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O
( 10 mg / kg ) , an inhibitor of DNA methylation , was given to rats during the phase of repair synthesis induced by the three carcinogens ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
benzo [ a ] - pyrene ( 200 mg / kg ) , N - methyl - N - nitrosourea ( 60 mg / kg ) and
B I I I I I O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O
1 , 2 - dimethylhydrazine ( 1 , 2 - DMH ) ( 100 mg / kg ) .
B I I I I O B I I I I O O O O O O O O
The initiated hepatocytes in the liver were assayed as the gamma - glutamyltransferase ( gamma - GT ) positive foci formed following a 2 - week selection regimen consisting of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dietary 0 . 02 % 2 - acetylaminofluorene coupled with a necrogenic dose of CCl4 .
O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B O
The results obtained indicate that with all three carcinogens , administration of 5 - AzC during repair synthesis increased the incidence of initiated hepatocytes , for example 10 - 20
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
foci / cm2 in 5 - AzC and carcinogen - treated rats compared with 3 - 5 foci / cm2 in rats treated with carcinogen only .
O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Administration of [ 3H ] - 5 - azadeoxycytidine during the repair synthesis induced by 1 , 2 - DMH further showed that 0 . 019 mol % of
O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O
cytosine residues in DNA were substituted by the analogue , indicating that incorporation of 5 - AzC occurs during repair synthesis .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O
In the absence of the carcinogen , 5 - AzC given after a two thirds partial hepatectomy , when its incorporation should be maximum , failed to induce any gamma
O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- GT positive foci .
O O O O O
The results suggest that hypomethylation of DNA per se may not be sufficient for initiation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Perhaps two events might be necessary for initiation , the first caused by the carcinogen and a second involving hypomethylation of DNA .

Withdrawal - emergent rabbit syndrome during dose reduction of risperidone .
O O O O O O O O O B O
Rabbit syndrome ( RS ) is a rare extrapyramidal side effect caused by prolonged neuroleptic medication .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here we present a case of withdrawal - emergent RS , which is the first of its kind to be reported .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient developed RS during dose reduction of risperidone .
O O O O O O O O B O
The symptom was treated successfully with trihexyphenidyl anticholinergic therapy .
O O O O O O B O O O
The underlying mechanism of withdrawal - emergent RS in the present case may have been related to the pharmacological profile of risperidone , a serotonin - dopamine antagonist , suggesting
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O B O O O
the pathophysiologic influence of the serotonin system in the development of RS .

for six doses and then every six hours until the plasma methotrexate level decreased to less than 1 X 10 ( - 7 ) mol / L .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mean steady - state plasma and CSF methotrexate concentrations achieved were 1 . 1 X 10 ( - 3 ) mol / L and 3 . 6 X 10

The interpeduncular nucleus regulates nicotine 's effects on free - field activity .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Partial lesions were made with kainic acid in the interpeduncular nucleus of the ventral midbrain of the rat .

To assess the added diagnostic value of a new cardiac performance index ( dP / dtejc ) measurement , based on brachial artery flow changes , as compared to standard
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
12 - lead ECG , for detecting dobutamine - induced myocardial ischemia , using Tc99m - Sestamibi single - photon emission computed tomography as the gold standard of comparison to
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
assess the presence or absence of ischemia .
O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
The study group comprised 40 patients undergoing Sestamibi - SPECT / dobutamine stress test .
O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O
Simultaneous measurements of ECG and brachial artery dP / dtejc were performed at each dobutamine level .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
In 19 of the 40 patients perfusion defects compatible with ischemia were detected on SPECT .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The increase in dP / dtejc during infusion of dobutamine in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non - ischemic group .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dP / dtejc outcome was combined with the ECG results , giving an ECG - enhanced value , and compared to ECG alone .

% , and specificity decreased from 90 % to 67 % .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
If ECG alone is used for specificity , the combination with dP / dtejc improved the sensitivity of the test and could be a cost - savings alternative to cardiac

Acute liver failure in two patients with regular alcohol consumption ingesting paracetamol at therapeutic dosage .
O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
The possible role of alcohol in the development of hepatotoxicity associated with therapeutic doses of paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) is currently debated .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
CASE REPORT :
O O O
We describe 2 patients who were regular consumers of alcohol and who developed liver failure within 3 - 5 days after hospitalization and stopping alcohol consumption while being treated with
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
4 g paracetamol / day .
O O B O O O
A paracetamol serum level obtained in one of these patients was not in the toxic range .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Possible risk factors for the development of hepatotoxicity in patients treated with therapeutic doses of paracetamol are discussed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
In patients with risk factors , e . g . regular consumption of alcohol , liver failure is possible when therapeutic doses are ingested .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
We propose that the paracetamol dose should not exceed 2 g / day in such patients and that their liver function should be monitored closely while being treated with
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
paracetamol .

Cocaine related chest pain :
B O O O O
are we seeing the tip of an iceberg ?
O O O O O O O O O
The recreational use of cocaine is on the increase .
O O O O B O O O O O
The emergency nurse ought to be familiar with some of the cardiovascular consequences of cocaine use .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
In particular , the tendency of cocaine to produce chest pain ought to be in the mind of the emergency nurse when faced with a young victim of chest pain
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
who is otherwise at low risk .
O O O O O O O
The mechanism of chest pain related to cocaine use is discussed and treatment dilemmas are discussed .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Finally , moral issues relating to the testing of potential cocaine users will be addressed .

Severe rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure secondary to concomitant use of simvastatin , amiodarone , and atazanavir .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O B O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To report a case of a severe interaction between simvastatin , amiodarone , and atazanavir resulting in rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure .
O O O O O O O O O B O B O O B O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
A 72 - year - old white man with underlying human immunodeficiency virus , atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease , and hyperlipidemia presented with generalized pain , fatigue ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and dark orange urine for 3 days .
O O O O O O O O
The patient was taking 80 mg simvastatin at bedtime ( initiated 27 days earlier ) ; amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg daily for 7 days , then 200
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mg daily ( initiated 19 days earlier ) ; and 400 mg atazanavir daily ( initiated at least 2 years previously ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Laboratory evaluation revealed 66 , 680 U / L creatine kinase , 93 mg / dL blood urea nitrogen , 4 . 6 mg / dL creatinine , 1579 U
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B O O O
/ L aspartate aminotransferase , and 738 U / L alanine aminotransferase .
O O B O O O O O O O B O O
Simvastatin , amiodarone , and the patient 's human immunodeficiency virus medications were all temporarily discontinued and the patient was given forced alkaline diuresis and started on dialysis .
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nine days later the patient 's creatine kinase had dropped to 1695 U / L and creatinine was 3 . 3 mg / dL . The patient was discharged and
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
continued outpatient dialysis for 1 month until his renal function recovered .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
DISCUSSION :
O O
The risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased in the presence of concomitant drugs that inhibit simvastatin metabolism .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Simvastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4 .
B O O O O O
Amiodarone and atazanavir are recognized CYP3A4 inhibitors .
B O B O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Pharmacokinetic differences in statins are an important consideration for assessing the risk of potential drug interactions .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In patients requiring the concurrent use of statins and CYP3A4 inhibitors , pravastatin , fluvastatin , and rosuvastatin carry the lowest risk of drug interactions ; atorvastatin carries moderate risk
O O O O O O O B O O O O B O B O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O
, whereas simvastatin and lovastatin have the highest risk and should be avoided in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors .

To evaluate the response rate and toxic effects of vinorelbine ( VNB ) administered as a single agent in metastatic squamous cell esophageal carcinoma .
O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PATIENTS AND METHODS :
O O O O
Forty - six eligible patients with measurable lesions were included and were stratified according to previous chemotherapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thirty patients without prior chemotherapy and 16 pretreated with cisplatin - based chemotherapy were assessable for toxicity and response .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
VNB was administered weekly as a 25 - mg / m2 short intravenous ( i . v . ) infusion .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Six of 30 patients ( 20 % ) without prior chemotherapy achieved a partial response ( PR ) ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 8 % to
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
39 % ) .
O O O O
The median duration of response was 21 weeks ( range , 17 to 28 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One of 16 patients ( 6 % ) with prior chemotherapy had a complete response ( CR ) of 31 weeks ' duration ( 95 % CI , 0 %
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to 30 % ) .
O O O O O
The overall response rate ( World Health Organization [ WHO ] criteria ) was 15 % ( CR , 2 % ; PR 13 % ; 95 % CI ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
6 % to 29 % ) .
O O O O O O O
The median dose - intensity ( DI ) was 20 mg / m2 / wk .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
VNB was well tolerated and zero instances of WHO grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At least one episode of grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia was seen in 59 % of patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A grade 2 or 3 infection occurred in 16 % of patients , but no toxic deaths occurred .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Other side effects were rare , and peripheral neurotoxicity has been minor ( 26 % grade 1 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
These data indicate that VNB is an active agent in metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Given its excellent tolerance profile and low toxicity , further evaluation of VNB in combination therapy is warranted .

Paclitaxel , cisplatin , and gemcitabine combination chemotherapy within a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach in metastatic nonsmall cell lung carcinoma .
B O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Cisplatin - based chemotherapy combinations improve quality of life and survival in advanced nonsmall cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The emergence of new active drugs might translate into more effective regimens for the treatment of this disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility , response rate , and toxicity of a paclitaxel , cisplatin , and gemcitabine combination to treat metastatic NSCLC .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O B O O O O O O
Thirty - five consecutive chemotherapy - naive patients with Stage IV NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 - 2 were treated with a combination of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
paclitaxel ( 135 mg / m ( 2 ) given intravenously in 3 hours ) on Day 1 , cisplatin ( 120 mg / m ( 2 ) given intravenously
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
in 6 hours ) on Day 1 , and gemcitabine ( 800 mg / m ( 2 ) given intravenously in 30 minutes ) on Days 1 and 8 ,
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
every 4 weeks .
O O O O
Although responding patients were scheduled to receive consolidation radiotherapy and 24 patients received preplanned second - line chemotherapy after disease progression , the response and toxicity rates reported refer only
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to the chemotherapy regimen given .
O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
All the patients were examined for toxicity ; 34 were examinable for response .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An objective response was observed in 73 . 5 % of the patients ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 55 . 6 - 87 . 1 %
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) , including 4 complete responses ( 11 . 7 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
According to intention - to - treat , the overall response rate was 71 . 4 % ( 95 % CI , 53 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
7 - 85 . 4 % ) .
O O O O O O O O
After 154 courses of therapy , the median dose intensity was 131 mg / m ( 2 ) for paclitaxel ( 97 . 3 % ) , 117 mg /
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
m ( 2 ) for cisplatin ( 97 . 3 % ) , and 1378 mg / m ( 2 ) for gemcitabine ( 86 . 2 % ) .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
World Health Organization Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 39 . 9 % and 11 . 4 % of patients , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was one treatment - related death .
O O O O O O O O
Nonhematologic toxicities were mild .
O O O O O
After a median follow - up of 22 months , the median progression free survival rate was 7 months , and the median survival time was 16 months .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
The combination of paclitaxel , cisplatin , and gemcitabine is well tolerated and shows high activity in metastatic NSCLC .

We prospectively evaluated the adverse reactions of apraclonidine in 20 normal volunteers by instilling a single drop of 1 % apraclonidine in their right eyes .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Examinations , including blood pressure , pulse rate , conjunctiva and cornea , intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , pupil diameter , basal tear secretion and margin reflex distance of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
both upper and lower eyelids , were performed prior to entry and at 1 , 3 , 5 and 7 hours after instillation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The ocular hypotensive effects were statistically significant for apraclonidine - treated eyes throughout the study and also statistically significant for contralateral eyes from three hours after topical administration of 1

Decreases in systolic blood pressure were statistically , but not clinically , significant .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No significant changes in diastolic blood pressure , pulse rate and basal tear secretion were noted .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Conjunctival blanching and mydriasis were commonly found .

Organic mental disorder was observed in a 29 - year - old female in the prognostic period after the onset of carmofur - induced leukoencephalopathy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Symptoms such as euphoria , emotional lability and puerile attitude noted in the patient were diagnosed as organic personality syndrome according to the criteria defined in the DSM - III

It is referred to as a frontal lobe syndrome .
O O O O O O O O O O
Brain CT revealed a periventricular low density area in the frontal white matter and moderate dilatation of the lateral ventricles especially at the bilateral anterior horns .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Consequently , carmofur - induced leukoencephalopathy may uncommonly result in organic personality syndrome in the residual state .

Impact Research Group .
O O O O
The antiarrhythmic effects of the sustained release form of mexiletine ( Mexitil - Perlongets ) were evaluated in a double - blind placebo trial in 630 patients with recent documented
O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
myocardial infarction .
O O O
The primary response variable was based on central reading of 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings and was defined as the occurrence of 30 or more single premature ventricular complexes in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
any two consecutive 30 minute blocks or one or more runs of two or more premature ventricular complexes in the entire 24 hour electrocardiographic recording .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Large differences , regarded as statistically significant , between the mexiletine and placebo groups were noted in that end point at months 1 and 4 , but only trends were
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
observed at month 12 .
O O O O O
These differences were observed even though the serum mexiletine levels obtained in this study were generally lower than those observed in studies that have used the regular form of the
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
drug .
O O
There were more deaths in the mexiletine group ( 7 . 6 % ) than in the placebo group ( 4 . 8 % ) ; the difference was not
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
statistically significant .

Regional localization of the antagonism of amphetamine - induced hyperactivity by intracerebral calcitonin injections .
O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O
Calcitonin receptors are found in the brain , and intracerebral infusions of calcitonin can produce behavioral effects .
B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Among these behavioral effects are decreases in food intake and decreases in amphetamine - induced locomotor activity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
In previous experiments we found that decreases in food intake were induced by local administration of calcitonin into several hypothalamic sites and into the nucleus accumbens .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
In the present experiment calcitonin decreased locomotor activity when locally injected into the same sites where it decreases food intake .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The areas where calcitonin is most effective in decreasing locomotor activity are located in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens , suggesting that these areas are the major sites of action
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of calcitonin in inhibiting amphetamine - induced locomotor activity .

We present a case of paramedic misjudgment in the execution of a protocol for the treatment of allergic reaction in a case of pulmonary edema with wheezing .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sudden onset of respiratory distress , rash , and a history of a new medicine led the two paramedics on the scene to administer subcutaneous epinephrine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Subsequently , acute cardiac arrest and fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Epinephrine has a proven role in cardiac arrest in prehospital care ; however , use by paramedics in patients with suspected allergic reaction and severe hypertension should be viewed with

Cardiovascular alterations in rat fetuses exposed to calcium channel blockers .
O O O O O O O B O O O
Preclinical toxicologic investigation suggested that a new calcium channel blocker , Ro 40 - 5967 , induced cardiovascular alterations in rat fetuses exposed to this agent during organogenesis .
O O O O O O O B O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The present study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that calcium channel blockers in general induce cardiovascular malformations indicating a pharmacologic class effect .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We studied three calcium channel blockers of different structure , nifedipine , diltiazem , and verapamil , along with the new agent .
O O O B O O O O O O B O B O O B O O O O O O O
Pregnant rats were administered one of these calcium channel blockers during the period of cardiac morphogenesis and the offspring examined on day 20 of gestation for cardiovascular malformations .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A low incidence of cardiovascular malformations was observed after exposure to each of the four calcium channel blockers , but this incidence was statistically significant only for verapamil and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O
nifedipine .

Differential impact of immune escape mutations G145R and P120 T on the replication of lamivudine - resistant hepatitis B virus e antigen - positive and - negative strains .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I I I O O O O O O O
Immune escape variants of the hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) represent an emerging clinical challenge , because they can be associated with vaccine escape , HBV reactivation , and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
failure of diagnostic tests .
O O O O O
Recent data suggest a preferential selection of immune escape mutants in distinct peripheral blood leukocyte compartments of infected individuals .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We therefore systematically analyzed the functional impact of the most prevalent immune escape variants , the sG145R and sP120 T mutants , on the viral replication efficacy and antiviral drug
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
susceptibility of common treatment - associated mutants with resistance to lamivudine ( LAM ) and / or HBeAg negativity .
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O B O O
Replication - competent HBV strains with sG145R or sP120 T and LAM resistance ( rtM204I or rtL180M / rtM204V ) were generated on an HBeAg - positive and an
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
HBeAg - negative background with precore ( PC ) and basal core promoter ( BCP ) mutants .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sG145R mutation strongly reduced HBsAg levels and was able to fully restore the impaired replication of LAM - resistant HBV mutants to the levels of wild - type HBV
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
, and PC or BCP mutations further enhanced viral replication .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Although the sP120 T substitution also impaired HBsAg secretion , it did not enhance the replication of LAM - resistant clones .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
However , the concomitant occurrence of HBeAg negativity ( PC / BCP ) , sP120 T , and LAM resistance resulted in the restoration of replication to levels of wild
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
- type HBV .
O O O O
In all clones with combined immune escape and LAM resistance mutations , the nucleotide analogues adefovir and tenofovir remained effective in suppressing viral replication in vitro .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O O O
These findings reveal the differential impact of immune escape variants on the replication and drug susceptibility of complex HBV mutants , supporting the need of close surveillance and treatment adjustment
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in response to the selection of distinct mutational patterns .

Infarct - avid radiopharmaceuticals are necessary for rapid and timely diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The animal model used to produce infarction implies artery ligation but chemical induction can be easily obtained with isoproterenol .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
A new infarct - avid radiopharmaceutical based on glucaric acid was prepared in the hospital radiopharmacy of the INCMNSZ .
O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
99mTc - glucarate was easy to prepare , stable for 96 h and was used to study its biodistribution in rats with isoproterenol - induced acute myocardial infarction .

A randomized , placebo - controlled dose - comparison trial of haloperidol for psychosis and disruptive behaviors in Alzheimer 's disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE : The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of two doses of haloperidol and placebo in the treatment of psychosis and disruptive behaviors
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
in patients with Alzheimer 's disease .
O O O O O O O
METHOD :
O O
In a 6 - week random - assignment , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial ( phase A ) , haloperidol , 2 - 3 mg / day
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
( standard dose ) , and haloperidol , 0 . 50 - 0 . 75 mg / day ( low dose ) , were compared in 71 outpatients with Alzheimer
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
's disease .
O O O
For the subsequent 6 - week double - blind crossover phase ( phase B ) , patients taking standard - or low - dose haloperidol were switched to placebo ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
and patients taking placebo were randomly assigned to standard - or low - dose haloperidol .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
RESULTS :
O O
For the 60 patients who completed phase A , standard - dose haloperidol was efficacious and superior to both low - dose haloperidol and placebo for scores on the Brief
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis factor and on psychomotor agitation .
O O O O O O O O O O
Response rates according to three sets of criteria were greater with the standard dose ( 55 % - 60 % ) than the low dose ( 25 % - 35
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
% ) and placebo ( 25 % - 30 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The advantage of standard dose over low dose was replicated in phase B .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In phase A , extrapyramidal signs tended to be greater with the standard dose than in the other two conditions , primarily because of a subgroup ( 20 % )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
who developed moderate to severe signs .
O O O O O O O
Low - dose haloperidol did not differ from placebo on any measure of efficacy or side effects .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
The results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for haloperidol in doses of 2 - 3 mg / day , although a subgroup developed moderate to severe extrapyramidal signs .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A starting dose of 1 mg / day with gradual , upward dose titration is recommended .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The narrow therapeutic window observed with haloperidol may also apply to other neuroleptics used in Alzheimer 's disease patients with psychosis and disruptive behaviors .

Individual differences in renal ACE activity in healthy rats predict susceptibility to adriamycin - induced renal damage .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
In man , differences in angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) levels , related to ACE ( I / D ) genotype , are associated with renal prognosis .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of renal damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
METHODS :
O O
Renal ACE activity ( Hip - His - Leu cleavage by cortical homogenates ) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats .
O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After 1 week of recovery , proteinuria was induced by adriamycin [ 1 . 5 mg / kg intravenously ( i . v . )
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
n = 18 ; controls , saline i . v .
O O O O O O O O O O O
n = 9 ] .
O O O O O
Proteinuria was measured every 2 weeks .
O O O O O O O
After 12 weeks , rats were sacrificed and their kidneys harvested .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
As anticipated , adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria , renal interstitial damage and mild focal glomerulosclerosis .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in proteinuria after adriamycin ( r = 0 . 62 , P < 0 . 01 ) , renal interstitial alpha
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- smooth muscle actin ( r = 0 . 49 , P < 0 . 05 ) , interstitial macrophage influx ( r = 0 . 56 , P <
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
0 . 05 ) , interstitial collagen III ( r = 0 . 53 , P < 0 . 05 ) , glomerular alpha - smooth muscle actin ( r
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
= 0 . 74 , P < 0 . 01 ) and glomerular desmin ( r = 0 . 48 , P < 0 . 05 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Baseline renal ACE did not correlate with focal glomerulosclerosis ( r = 0 . 22 , NS ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In controls , no predictive values for renal parameters were observed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Individual differences in renal ACE activity predict the severity of adriamycin - induced renal damage in this outbred rat strain .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
This supports the assumption that differences in renal ACE activity predispose to a less favourable course of renal damage .

Nearly 3 . 2 million people in this country receive aminoglycoside antibiotics annually .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Gentamicin sulfate and tobramycin sulfate continue to demonstrate ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity in both animal and clinical studies .
B I O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this study , 62 patients with confirmed initial normal renal function and treated with 2 to 5 mg / kg / day of gentamicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate for
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I O
a minimum of seven days were followed up prospectively for the development of aminoglycoside - related renal failure , defined as at least a one - third reduction in renal
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
function .
O O
In these 62 patients , no other causes for renal failure could be identified .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Five of 33 ( 15 % ) of the tobramycin - treated patients and 16 of 29 ( 55 . 2 % ) of the gentamicin - treated patients had
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
renal failure .
O O O
Thus , gentamicin was associated with renal failure more than three times as often as was tobramycin .

Neuroprotective action of MPEP , a selective mGluR5 antagonist , in methamphetamine - induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is associated with a decrease in dopamine outflow and inhibition of hyperthermia in rats
O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
.

The aim of this study was to examine the role of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 ( mGluR5 ) in the toxic action of methamphetamine on dopaminergic neurones in rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Methamphetamine ( 10 mg / kg sc ) , administered five times , reduced the levels of dopamine and its metabolites in striatal tissue when measured 72 h after the
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
last injection .
O O O
A selective antagonist of mGluR5 , 2 - methyl - 6 - ( phenylethynyl ) pyridine ( MPEP ; 5 mg / kg ip ) , when administered five times
O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
immediately before each methamphetamine injection reversed the above - mentioned methamphetamine effects .
O O O B O O O O O O B O O
A single MPEP ( 5 mg / kg ip ) injection reduced the basal extracellular dopamine level in the striatum , as well as dopamine release stimulated either by
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O
methamphetamine ( 10 mg / kg sc ) or by intrastriatally administered veratridine ( 100 microM ) .
B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Moreover , it transiently diminished the methamphetamine ( 10 mg / kg sc ) - induced hyperthermia and reduced basal body temperature .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
MPEP administered into the striatum at high concentrations ( 500 microM ) increased extracellular dopamine levels , while lower concentrations ( 50 - 100 microM ) were devoid of any
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
effect .
O O
The results of this study suggest that the blockade of mGluR5 by MPEP may protect dopaminergic neurones against methamphetamine - induced toxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O
Neuroprotection rendered by MPEP may be associated with the reduction of the methamphetamine - induced dopamine efflux in the striatum due to the blockade of extrastriatal mGluR5 , and with
O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a decrease in hyperthermia .

OBJECTIVE : In vitro work has demonstrated that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme ( CYP ) 2D6 .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cinacalcet on CYP2D6 activity , using desipramine as a probe substrate , in healthy subjects .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Seventeen subjects who were genotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers were enrolled in this randomized , open - label , crossover study to receive a single oral dose of desipramine (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
50 mg ) on two separate occasions , once alone and once after multiple doses of cinacalcet ( 90 mg for 7 days ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Blood samples were obtained predose and up to 72 h postdose .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Fourteen subjects completed both treatment arms .
O O O O O O O
Relative to desipramine alone , mean AUC and C ( max ) of desipramine increased 3 . 6 - and 1 . 8 - fold when coadministered with cinacalcet .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The t ( 1 / 2 , z ) of desipramine was longer when desipramine was coadministered with cinacalcet ( 21 . 0 versus 43 . 3 hs ) .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
The t ( max ) was similar between the regimens .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Fewer subjects reported adverse events following treatment with desipramine alone than when receiving desipramine with cinacalcet ( 33 versus 86 % ) , the most frequent of which ( nausea
O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and headache ) have been reported for patients treated with either desipramine or cinacalcet .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
CONCLUSION :
O O
This study demonstrates that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 .
O O O O B O O O O O O O
These data suggest that during concomitant treatment with cinacalcet , dose adjustment may be necessary for drugs that demonstrate a narrow therapeutic index and are metabolized by CYP2D6 .

A few minutes after administration of the drugs , they presented urticaria ( patients 1 and 2 ) and conjunctivitis ( patient 1 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The purpose of our study was to determine the cause of the patients ' reactions , the immunological mechanisms involved and whether these patients would be able to tolerate any
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
kind of corticoid .
O O O O
Clinical examinations and skin , oral and parenteral challenges with different corticosteroids and ELISA tests were performed .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
In the two patients , skin and ELISA tests with paramethasone were negative , as was the prick test with each of its excipients .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A single - blind parenteral challenge with Triniol was positive in both patients after the administration of 1 ml of the drug , and negative with its excipients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We also carried out oral and parenteral challenges with other corticosteroids and found intolerance to some of them .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that paramethasone caused pseudoallergic reactions in our patients .
O O O O B O O O O O O O
Corticosteroids different from paramethasone also produced hypersensitivity reactions in these patients ; however , a few of them were tolerated .

possibility that M . S . changes are due to blockade of histamine H2 - receptors in the central nervous system .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Patients likely to have both raised trough - concentrations and mental confusion are those with both severe renal and hepatic dysfunction .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They should be closely observed and should be given reduced doses of cimetidine .

Different lobular distributions of altered hepatocyte tight junctions in rat models of intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hepatocyte tight junctions ( TJs ) , the only intercellular barrier between the sinusoidal and the canalicular spaces , play a key role in bile formation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although hepatocyte TJs are impaired in cholestasis , attempts to localize the precise site of hepatocyte TJ damage by freeze - fracture electron microscopy have produced limited information .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recently , several TJ - associated proteins like ZO - 1 and 7H6 have been identified and characterized .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Immunolocalization of 7H6 appears to closely correlate with paracellular permeability .
O O O O O O O O O O O
We used rat models of intrahepatic cholestasis by ethinyl estradiol ( EE ) treatment and extrahepatic cholestasis by bile duct ligation ( BDL ) to precisely determine the site of
O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
TJ damage .
O O O
Alterations in hepatocyte TJs were assessed by double - immunolabeling for 7H6 and ZO - 1 using a confocal laser scanning microscope .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In control rats , immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO - 1 colocalized to outline bile canaliculi in a continuous fashion .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , 7H6 and ZO - 1 immunostaining was more discontinuous , outlining the bile canaliculi after BDL .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Immunostaining for 7H6 , not ZO - 1 , decreased and predominantly appeared as discrete signals in the submembranous cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes after BDL .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After EE treatment , changes in immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO - 1 were similar to those seen in periportal hepatocytes after BDL , but distributed more diffusely throughout the
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lobule .
O O
This study is the first to demonstrate that impairment of hepatocyte TJs occurs heterogenously in the liver lobule after BDL and suggests that BDL and EE treatments produce different lobular
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
distributions of increased paracellular permeability .

Long term audiological evaluation of beta - thalassemic patients .
O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to identify the incidence and to monitor the progression of hearing loss in children and young adults with beta - thalassemia major
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.

METHODS :
O O
One hundred and four ( 104 ) patients aged 6 - 35 years ( mean 17 , 2 years ) participated in the study .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All patients were on a regular transfusion - chelation program maintaining a mean hemoglobin level of 9 . 5 gr / dl .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Subjects were receiving desferrioxamine ( DFO ) chelation treatment with a mean daily dose of 50 - 60 mg / kg , 5 - 6 days a week during the
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first six years of the study , which was then reduced to 40 - 50 mg / kg for the following eight years .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients were followed for 8 - 14 years .
O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Overall , 21 out of 104 patients ( 20 . 2 % ) presented with high frequency sensorineural hearing loss ( SNHL ) , either unilateral or bilateral .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No ototoxic factor , other than DFO , was present in any of the patients .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Patients with SNHL presented with relatively lower serum ferritin levels than those with normal hearing , however , no statistically significant difference was observed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Subjects with SNHL were submitted to DFO reduction or temporary withdrawal .
O O O O O O B O O O O O
Following intervention , 7 out of 21 affected patients recovered , 10 remained stable and 4 demonstrated aggravation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
The findings are indicative of DFO 's contributing role in the development of hearing impairment .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Regular audiologic evaluation is imperative in all thalassemic patients so that early changes may be recognized and treatment may be judiciously adjusted in order to prevent or reverse hearing impairment

Design and analysis of the HYPREN - trial : safety of enalapril and prazosin in the initial treatment phase of patients with congestive heart failure .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Since the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors into the adjunctive treatment of patients with congestive heart failure , cases of severe hypotension , especially on the
O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first day of treatment , have occasionally been reported .
O O O O O O O O O O
To assess the safety of the ACE inhibitor enalapril a multicenter , randomized , prazosin - controlled trial was designed that compared the incidence and severity of symptomatic hypotension on
O O O O O O B I B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first day of treatment .
O O O O O O
Trial medication was 2 . 5 mg enalapril or 0 . 5 prazosin .
O O O O O O O B O O O O B O
Subjects were 1210 inpatients with New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional class II and III .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients who received enalapril experienced clinically and statistically significantly less symptomatic hypotension ( 5 . 2 % ) than the patients who received prazosin ( 12 . 9 % )
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
.
O
All patients recovered .
O O O O
It was concluded that treatment with enalapril was well tolerated and it is , therefore , unreasonable to restrict the initiation of treatment with enalapril to inpatients .

Antagonism between interleukin 3 and erythropoietin in mice with azidothymidine - induced anemia and in bone marrow endothelial cells .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Azidothymidine ( AZT ) - induced anemia in mice can be reversed by the administration of IGF - IL - 3 ( fusion protein of insulin - like growth factor
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
II ( IGF II ) and interleukin 3 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O
Although interleukin 3 ( IL - 3 ) and erythropoietin ( EPO ) are known to act synergistically on hematopoietic cell proliferation in vitro , injection of IGF - IL
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- 3 and EPO in AZT - treated mice resulted in a reduction of red cells and an increase of plasma EPO levels as compared to animals treated with IGF
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- IL - 3 or EPO alone .
O O O O O O O O
We tested the hypothesis that the antagonistic effect of IL - 3 and EPO on erythroid cells may be mediated by endothelial cells .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bovine liver erythroid cells were cultured on monolayers of human bone marrow endothelial cells previously treated with EPO and IGF - IL - 3 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was a significant reduction of thymidine incorporation into both erythroid and endothelial cells in cultures pre - treated with IGF - IL - 3 and EPO .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Endothelial cell culture supernatants separated by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation from cells treated with EPO and IL - 3 significantly reduced thymidine incorporation into erythroid cells as compared to identical fractions
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
obtained from the media of cells cultured with EPO alone .
O O O O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that endothelial cells treated simultaneously with EPO and IL - 3 have a negative effect on erythroid cell production .

O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At normal [ Na ] o , decrease ( 0 . 675 mM ) or increase ( 3 . 6 mM ) of [ Ca ] o did not modify

Dose - dependent bradycardia induced by verapamil was potentiated by LNa , LCa , and HCa .

Independent but not additive effects of Na and Ca are shown by decreases in the values of [ verapamil ] o needed to reduce BF by 30 % ( IC30

) with the following order of inhibitory potency : LNa > LCa > HCa > N , resulting LNa + HCa similar to LNa .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The [ verapamil ] o that arrested atrial beating ( AC ) was also potentiated with the order LNa

Sodium status influences chronic amphotericin B nephrotoxicity in rats .
B O O O B I O O O O
The nephrotoxic potential of amphotericin B ( 5 mg / kg per day intraperitoneally for 3 weeks ) has been investigated in salt - depleted , normal - salt ,
O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and salt - loaded rats .
O O O O O O
In salt - depleted rats , amphotericin B decreased creatinine clearance linearly with time , with an 85 % reduction by week 3 .
O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , in normal - salt rats creatinine clearance was decreased but to a lesser extent at week 2 and 3 , and in salt - loaded rats
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
creatinine clearance did not change for 2 weeks and was decreased by 43 % at week 3 .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All rats in the sodium - depleted group had histopathological evidence of patchy tubular cytoplasmic degeneration in tubules that was not observed in any normal - salt or salt -
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
loaded rat .
O O O
Concentrations of amphotericin B in plasma were not significantly different among the three groups at any time during the study .
O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , at the end of 3 weeks , amphotericin B levels in the kidneys and liver were significantly higher in salt - depleted and normal - salt rats than
O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
those in salt - loaded rats , with plasma / kidney ratios of 21 , 14 , and 8 in salt - depleted , normal - salt , and salt
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- loaded rats , respectively .
O O O O O O
In conclusion , reductions in creatinine clearance and renal amphotericin B accumulation after chronic amphotericin B administration were enhanced by salt depletion and attenuated by sodium loading in rats .

Reversible inferior colliculus lesion in metronidazole - induced encephalopathy : magnetic resonance findings on diffusion - weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
This is to present reversible inferior colliculus lesions in metronidazole - induced encephalopathy , to focus on the diffusion - weighted imaging ( DWI ) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( FLAIR ) imaging .
O O O O O
MATERIALS AND METHODS :
O O O O
From November 2005 to September 2007 , 8 patients ( 5 men and 3 women ) were diagnosed as having metronidazole - induced encephalopathy ( age range ; 43 -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
78 years ) .
O O O O
They had been taking metronidazole ( total dosage , 45 - 120 g ; duration , 30 days to 2 months ) to treat the infection in various organs .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) were obtained after the hospitalization , including DWI ( 8 / 8 ) , apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) map (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 / 8 ) , FLAIR ( 7 / 8 ) , and T2 - weighted image ( 8 / 8 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Follow - up MRIs were performed on 5 patients from third to 14th days after discontinuation of metronidazole administration .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Findings of initial and follow - up MRIs were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists by consensus , to analyze the presence of abnormal signal intensities , their locations , and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
signal changes on follow - up images .
O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Initial MRIs showed abnormal high signal intensities on DWI and FLAIR ( or T2 - weighted image ) at the dentate nucleus ( 8 / 8 ) , inferior colliculus
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( 6 / 8 ) , corpus callosum ( 2 / 8 ) , pons ( 2 / 8 ) , medulla ( 1 / 8 ) , and bilateral
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cerebral white matter ( 1 / 8 ) .
O O O O O O O O O
High - signal intensity lesions on DWI tended to show low signal intensity on ADC map ( 3 / 4 ) , but in one patient , high signal intensity
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was shown at bilateral dentate nuclei on not only DWI but also ADC map .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All the lesions in dentate , inferior colliculus , pons , and medullas had been resolved completely on follow - up MRIs in 5 patients , but in 1 patient
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of them , corpus callosal lesion persisted .
O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Reversible inferior colliculus lesions could be considered as the characteristic for metronidazole - induced encephalopathy , next to the dentate nucleus involvement .

O O B O O O O O O O
The incidence of postoperative respiratory apnoea was compared between five patients receiving a continuous i . v .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
infusion of morphine ( mean 73 . 6 mg ) and five patients receiving a continuous extradural infusion of 0 . 25 % bupivacaine ( mean 192 mg ) in
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
the 24 - h period following upper abdominal surgery .
O O O O O O O O O O
Monitoring consisted of airflow detection by a carbon dioxide analyser , chest wall movement detected by pneumatic capsules , and continuous electrocardiograph recorded with a Holter ambulatory monitor .
O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both obstructive ( P less than 0 . 05 ) and central apnoea ( P less than 0 . 05 ) occurred more frequently in patients who had a
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
morphine infusion .
B O O
There was also a higher incidence of tachyarrhythmias ( P less than 0 . 05 ) and ventricular ectopic beats ( P less than 0 . 05 ) in the

Magnetic resonance volumetry of the cerebellum in epileptic patients after phenytoin overdosages .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O
The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between phenytoin medication and cerebellar atrophy in patients who had experienced clinical intoxication .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Five females and 6 males , 21 - 59 years of age , were examined with a 1 . 5 - T whole - body system using a circular polarized
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
head coil .
O O O
Conventional spin echo images were acquired in the sagittal and transverse orientation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , we performed a high - resolution 3D gradient echo , T1 - weighted sequences at a 1 - mm slice thickness .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The images were subsequently processed to obtain volumetric data for the cerebellum .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cerebellar volume for the patient group ranged between 67 . 66 and 131 . 08 ml ( mean 108 . 9 ml ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition 3D gradient echo data sets from 10 healthy male and
O O O O O O O O O O O O
10 healthy female age - matched volunteers were used to compare cerebellar volumes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Using linear regression we found that no correlation exists between seizure duration , elevation of phenytoin serum levels and cerebellar volume .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
However , multiple regression for the daily dosage , duration of phenytoin treatment and cerebellar volume revealed a correlation of these parameters .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
We conclude that phenytoin overdosage does not necessarily result in cerebellar atrophy and it is unlikely that phenytoin medication was the only cause of cerebellar atrophy in the remaining patients

Evaluation of cardiac troponin I and T levels as markers of myocardial damage in doxorubicin - induced cardiomyopathy rats , and their relationship with echocardiographic and histological findings .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Cardiac troponins I ( cTnI ) and T
O O O O O O O O
( cTnT ) have been shown to be highly sensitive and specific markers of myocardial cell injury .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of myocardial damage in a rat model of doxorubicin ( DOX ) - induced cardiomyopathy , and we
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O
examined the relationship between serial cTnI
O O O O O O
and cTnT with the development of cardiac disorders monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Thirty - five Wistar rats were given 1 . 5 mg / kg DOX , i . v . , weekly for up to 8 weeks for a total cumulative
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dose of 12 mg / kg BW .
O O O O O O O O
Ten rats received saline as a control group .
O O O O O O O O O
cTnI was measured with Access ( R )
O O O O O O O O
( ng / ml ) and a research immunoassay ( pg / ml ) , and compared with cTnT
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, CK - MB mass and CK .
O O O O O O O O
By using transthoracic echocardiography , anterior and posterior wall thickness , LV diameters and LV fractional shortening ( FS ) were measured in all rats before DOX or saline ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
and at weeks 6 and 9 after treatment in all surviving rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Histology was performed in DOX - rats at 6 and 9 weeks after the last DOX dose and in all controls .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Eighteen of the DOX rats died prematurely of general toxicity during the 9 - week period .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
End - diastolic ( ED ) and end - systolic ( ES ) LV diameters / BW significantly increased , whereas LV FS was decreased after 9 weeks in the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DOX group ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
B O O O O O O O O O
These parameters remained unchanged in controls .
O O O O O O O
Histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given DOX revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
In 7 of the 18 rats , degeneration and myocyte vacuolisation were found .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Only five of the controls exhibited evidence of very slight perivascular fibrosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A significant rise in cTnT was found in DOX rats after cumulative doses of 7 . 5 and 12 mg / kg in comparison with baseline ( p < 0
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
. 05 ) .
O O O O
cTnT
O
found in rats after 12 mg / kg were significantly greater than that found after 7 . 5 mg / kg DOX .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Maximal cTnI ( pg / ml ) and cTnT
O O O O O O O O O
levels were significantly increased in DOX rats compared with controls ( p = 0 . 006 , 0 . 007 ) .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cTnI
O
( ng / ml ) , CK - MB mass and CK remained unchanged in DOX rats compared with controls .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
All markers remained stable in controls .
O O O O O O O
Analysis of data revealed a significant correlation between maximal cTnT and ED and ES LV diameters / BW ( r = 0 . 81 and 0 . 65 ; p
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
< 0 . 0001 ) .
O O O O O O
A significant relationship was observed between maximal cTnT
O O O O O O O O
and the extent of myocardial morphological changes , and between LV diameters / BW and histological findings .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Among markers of ischemic injury after DOX in rats , cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect myocardial damage assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after DOX , probably due to heterogeneity in cross - reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
forms , it is likely that cTnT in rats after DOX indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for

Calcineurin - inhibitor induced pain syndrome ( CIPS ) : a severe disabling complication after organ transplantation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bone pain after transplantation is a frequent complication that can be caused by several diseases .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Treatment strategies depend on the correct diagnosis of the pain .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Nine patients with severe pain in their feet , which was registered after transplantation , were investigated .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bone scans showed an increased tracer uptake of the foot bones .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bone marrow oedema in the painful bones .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pain was not explained by other diseases causing foot pain , like reflex sympathetic dystrophy , polyneuropathy , Morton 's neuralgia , gout , osteoporosis , avascular necrosis , intermittent
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
claudication , orthopaedic foot deformities , stress fractures , and hyperparathyroidism .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The reduction of cyclosporine - or tacrolimus trough levels and the administration of calcium channel blockers led to relief of pain .
O O O B O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
The Calcineurin - inhibitor Induced Pain Syndrome ( CIPS ) is a rare but severe side effect of cyclosporine or tacrolimus and is accurately diagnosed by its typical presentation ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O
magnetic resonance imaging and bone scans .
O O O O O O O
Incorrect diagnosis of the syndrome will lead to a significant reduction of life quality in patients suffering from CIPS .

The haemodynamic effects of propofol in combination with ephedrine in elderly patients ( ASA groups 3 and 4 ) .
O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
The marked vasodilator and negative inotropic effects of propofol are disadvantages in frail elderly patients .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
We investigated the safety and efficacy of adding different doses of ephedrine to propofol in order to obtund the hypotensive response .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O
The haemodynamic effects of adding 15 , 20 or 25 mg of ephedrine to 200 mg of propofol were compared to control in 40 ASA 3 / 4 patients over
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
60 years presenting for genito - urinary surgery .
O O O O O O O O O
The addition of ephedrine to propofol appears to be an effective method of obtunding the hypotensive response to propofol at all doses used in this study .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
However , marked tachycardia associated with the use of ephedrine in combination with propofol occurred in the majority of patients , occasionally reaching high levels in individual patients .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Due to the risk of this tachycardia inducing myocardial ischemia , we would not recommend the use in elderly patients of any of the ephedrine / propofol / mixtures studied

Neurotoxicity of halogenated hydroxyquinolines : clinical analysis of cases reported outside Japan .
O O B I O O O O O O O O O
An analysis is presented of 220 cases of possible neurotoxic reactions to halogenated hydroxyquinolines reported from outside Japan .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
In 80 cases insufficient information was available for adequate comment and in 29 a relationship to the administration of clioquinol could be excluded .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Of the remainder , a relationship to clioquinol was considered probable in 42 and possible in 69 cases .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
In six of the probable cases the neurological disturbance consisted of an acute reversible encephalopathy usually related to the ingestion of a high dose of clioquinol over a short period
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
.
O
The most common manifestation , observed in 15 further cases , was isolated optic atrophy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This was most frequently found in children , many of whom had received clioquinol as treatment for acrodermatitis enteropathica .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
In the remaining cases , a combination of myelopathy , visual disturbance , and peripheral neuropathy was the most common manifestation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Isolated myelopathy or peripheral neuropathy , or these manifestations occurring together , were infrequent .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The onset of all manifestations ( except toxic encephalopathy ) was usually subacute , with subsequent partial recovery .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Older subjects tended to display more side effects .
O O O O O O O O O
The full syndrome of subacute myelo - optic neuropathy was more frequent in women , but they tended to have taken greater quantities of the drug .

Epileptic seizures following cortical application of fibrin sealants containing tranexamic acid in rats .
O O O O O O O O O B I O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Fibrin sealants ( FS ) derived from human plasma are frequently used in neurosurgery .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In order to increase clot stability , FS typically contain aprotinin , a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recently , synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid ( tAMCA ) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin .
O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O
However , tAMCA has been shown to cause epileptic seizures .
O O B O O O O O O O O
We wanted to study whether tAMCA retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a FS .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
METHOD :
O O
FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tAMCA ( 0 . 5 - 47 . 5 mg / ml ) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anaesthetized rats .
O O O
The response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
FINDINGS : FS containing tAMCA caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
The degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tAMCA .
O O O O O O O O O O B O
Thus , FS containing 47 . 5 mg / ml tAMCA evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats ( n = 6 ) while the lowest concentration of tAMCA (
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
0 . 5 mg / ml ) only evoked brief episodes of jerk - correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , FS containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
INTERPRETATION :
O O
Tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within FS .
B I O O O O O O O
Thus , use of FS containing tAMCA for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient .

A diet promoting sugar dependency causes behavioral cross - sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Previous research in this laboratory has shown that a diet of intermittent excessive sugar consumption produces a state with neurochemical and behavioral similarities to drug dependency .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The present study examined whether female rats on various regimens of sugar access would show behavioral cross - sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
After a 30 - min baseline measure of locomotor activity ( day 0 ) , animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12 - h deprivation followed by 12
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- h access to 10 % sucrose solution and chow pellets ( 12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period ) for 21 days .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Locomotor activity was measured again for 30 min at the beginning of days 1 and 21 of sugar access .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Beginning on day 22 , all rats were maintained on ad libitum chow .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of amphetamine ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
The animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups ( ad libitum 10 % sucrose and chow followed by
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
amphetamine injection , cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection , ad libitum chow with amphetamine , or cyclic 10 % sucrose and chow with a saline injection ) .
B O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that a diet comprised of alternating deprivation and access to a sugar solution and chow produces bingeing on sugar that leads to a long lasting state of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
increased sensitivity to amphetamine , possibly due to a lasting alteration in the dopamine system .

D - penicillamine - induced angiopathy in rats .
B I I O O O O O O
The effect of high dose D - penicillamine treatment on aortic permeability to albumin and on the ultrastructure of the vessel .
O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Male Sprague - Dawley rats were treated with D - penicillamine ( D - pen ) 500 mg / kg / day for 10 or 42 days .
O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pair fed rats served as controls .
O O O O O O O
Changes in aortic morphology were examined by light - and transmission - electron microscopy ( TEM ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , the endothelial permeability and the penetration through the aortic wall of albumin were studied 10 minutes , 24 and 48 hours after i . v . injection
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of human serum 131I - albumin ( 131I - HSA ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
TEM revealed extensive elastolysis in the arterial wall of D - pen - treated rats , consistent with an inhibitory effect on crosslink formation .
O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In experimental animals excess deposition of collagen and glycoaminoglycans was observed in the subendothelial and medial layer of the aortic wall , together with prominent basal membrane substance around aortic
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
smooth muscle cells .
O O O O
The aorta / serum - ratio and the radioactive build - up 24 and 48 hours after injection of 131I - HSA was reduced in animals treated with
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
D - pen for 42 days , indicating an impeded transmural transport of tracer which may be caused by a steric exclusion effect of abundant hyaluronate .
B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The endothelial ultrastructure was unaffected by D - pen , and no differences in aortic 131I - HSA radioactivity or aorta / serum - ratio were recorded between experimental and
O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
control groups 10 minutes after tracer injection , indicating that the permeability of the endothelial barrier to albumin remained unaffected by D - pen treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
These observations support the hypothesis that treatment with high doses of D - pen may induce a fibroproliferative response in rat aorta , possibly by an inhibitory effect on the
O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cross - linking of collagen and elastin .

Brain natriuretic peptide is a predictor of anthracycline - induced cardiotoxicity .
O O O O O O O B O O O O
Anthracyclines are effective antineoplastic drugs , but they frequently cause dose - related cardiotoxicity .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The cardiotoxicity of conventional anthracycline therapy highlights a need to search for methods that are highly sensitive and capable of predicting cardiac dysfunction .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We measured the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) to determine whether BNP might serve as a simple diagnostic indicator of anthracycline - induced cardiotoxicity in patients
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
with acute leukemia treated with a daunorubicin ( DNR ) - containing regimen .
O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
Thirteen patients with acute leukemia were treated with a DNR - containing regimen .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Cardiac functions were evaluated with radionuclide angiography before chemotherapies .
O O O O O O O O O O
The plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) and BNP were measured at the time of radionuclide angiography .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Three patients developed congestive heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Five patients were diagnosed as having subclinical heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The plasma levels of BNP in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure increased above the normal limit ( 40 pg / ml ) before the detection of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
clinical or subclinical heart failure by radionuclide angiography .
O O O O O O O O O
On the other hand , BNP did not increase in the patients without heart failure given DNR , even at more than 700 mg / m ( 2 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The plasma level of ANP did not always increase in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These preliminary results suggest that BNP may be useful as an early and sensitive indicator of anthracycline - induced cardiotoxicity .

Incidence of neoplasms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis exposed to different treatment regimens .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Immunosuppressive drugs have been used during the last 30 years in treatment of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The drugs commonly used are cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil ( alkylating agents ) , azathioprine ( purine analogue ) , and methotrexate ( folic acid analogue ) .
O O O O O B O B O B I O O B O B O O O O B O B I O O O
There is evidence that all four immunosuppressive drugs can reduce synovitis , but disease activity almost always recurs after therapy is stopped .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Since adverse reactions are frequent , less than 50 percent of patients are able to continue a particular drug for more than one year .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Since it takes three to 12 months to achieve maximal effects , those patients who are unable to continue the drug receive little benefit from it .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients treated with alkylating agents have an increased risk of development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia , and both alkylating agents and azathioprine are associated with the development of non -

O O O O O O O
Of 20 patients evaluable for toxicity , four had stage III and 16 had stage IV disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Treatment , given every 21 days for a maximum of three cycles , consisted of paclitaxel by 3 - hour infusion followed the next day by a fixed dose of

cisplatin ( 75 mg / m2 ) .
B O O O O O O O
The dose levels incorporate escalating paclitaxel doses , and intrapatient escalations within a given dose level are permitted if toxicity permits .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At the time of this writing , dose level 4 ( 260 , 270 , and 280 mg / m2 ) is being evaluated ; three patients from this level

Differential effects of gamma - hexachlorocyclohexane ( lindane ) on pharmacologically - induced seizures .
O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O
Gamma - hexachlorocyclohexane ( gamma - HCH ) , the active ingredient of the insecticide lindane , has been shown to decrease seizure threshold to pentylenetrazol ( PTZ ) 3
B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
h after exposure to gamma - HCH and conversely increase threshold to PTZ - induced seizures 24 h after exposure to gamma - HCH ( Vohland et al . 1981
O O O O B I I O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O
) .
O O
In this study , the severity of response to other seizure - inducing agents was tested in mice 1 and 24 h after intraperitoneal administration of 80 mg / kg
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
gamma - HCH .
B I I O
One hour after the administration of gamma - HCH , the activity of seizure - inducing agents was increased , regardless of their mechanism , while 24 h after
O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
gamma - HCH a differential response was observed .
B I I O O O O O O
Seizure activity due to PTZ and picrotoxin ( PTX ) was significantly decreased ; however , seizure activity due to 3 - mercaptopropionic acid ( MPA ) , bicuculline (
O O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O O B O
BCC ) , methyl 6 , 7 - dimethoxy - 4 - ethyl - B - carboline - 3 - carboxylate ( DMCM ) , or strychnine ( STR )

In vitro , gamma - HCH , pentylenetetrazol and picrotoxin were shown to inhibit 3H - TBOB binding in mouse whole brain , with IC50 values of 4 . 6
O O O B I I O B O B O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, 404 and 9 . 4 microM , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O
MPA , BCC , DMCM , and STR showed no inhibition of 3H - TBOB ( t - butyl bicyclo - orthobenzoate ) binding at concentrations of 100 micron .
B O B O B O O B O O O O B I I O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O
The pharmacological challenge data suggest that tolerance may occur to seizure activity induced by PTZ and PTX 24 h after gamma - HCH , since the response to only these
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O B I I O O O O O O O
two seizure - inducing agents is decreased .
O O O O O O O O
The in vitro data suggest that the site responsible for the decrease in seizure activity 24 h after gamma - HCH may be the GABA - A receptor - linked

Severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Glioblastoma is a malignant tumor that occurs in the cerebrum during adulthood .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
With current treatment regimens including combined surgery , radiation and chemotherapy , the average life expectancy of the patients is limited to approximately 1 year .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , patients with glioblastoma sometimes have intracarotid injection of carcinostatics added to the treatment regimen .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Generally , carboplatin is said to have milder side effects than cisplatin , whose ocular and orbital toxicity are well known .
O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
However , we experienced a case of severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin , which is infrequently reported .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
CASE :
O O
A 58 - year - old man received an intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas in his left temporal lobe .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
He complained of pain and visual disturbance in the ipsilateral eye 30 h after the injection .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Various ocular symptoms and findings caused by carboplatin toxicity were seen .
O O O O O O O B O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
He was treated with intravenous administration of corticosteroids and glycerin for 6 days after the injection .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Although the intraocular pressure elevation caused by secondary acute angle - closure glaucoma decreased and ocular pain diminished , inexorable papilledema and exudative retinal detachment continued for 3 weeks .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Finally , 6 weeks later , diffuse chorioretinal atrophy with optic atrophy occurred and the vision in his left eye was lost .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
When performing intracarotid injection of carboplatin , we must be aware of its potentially blinding ocular toxicity .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is recommended that further studies and investigations are undertaken in the effort to minimize such severe side effects .

Alpha - lipoic acid prevents mitochondrial damage and neurotoxicity in experimental chemotherapy neuropathy .
B I I I O O O O O O O O O O
The study investigates if alpha - lipoic acid is neuroprotective against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity , if mitochondrial damage plays a critical role in toxic neurodegenerative cascade , and if neuroprotective
O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
effects of alpha - lipoic acid depend on mitochondria protection .
O O B I I I O O O O O
We used an in vitro model of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy that closely mimic the in vivo condition by exposing primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) sensory
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
neurons to paclitaxel and cisplatin , two widely used and highly effective chemotherapeutic drugs .
O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
This approach allowed investigating the efficacy of alpha - lipoic acid in preventing axonal damage and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents
O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and alpha - lipoic acid .
O B I I I O
Our results demonstrate that both cisplatin and paclitaxel cause early mitochondrial impairment with loss of membrane potential and induction of autophagic vacuoles in neurons .
O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Alpha - lipoic acid exerts neuroprotective effects against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity in sensory neurons : it rescues the mitochondrial toxicity and induces the expression of frataxin , an essential mitochondrial
B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
protein with anti - oxidant and chaperone properties .
O O O O O O O O O
In conclusion mitochondrial toxicity is an early common event both in paclitaxel and cisplatin induced neurotoxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O
Alpha - lipoic acid protects sensory neurons through its anti - oxidant and mitochondrial regulatory functions , possibly inducing the expression of frataxin .
B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings suggest that alpha - lipoic acid might reduce the risk of developing peripheral nerve toxicity in patients undergoing chemotherapy and encourage further confirmatory clinical trials .

Optimising stroke prevention in non - valvular atrial fibrillation .
O O O O O O O O O O
Atrial fibrillation is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality .
O O O O O O O O O O
Pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo have shown that warfarin reduces the risk of stroke by 62 % , and that aspirin alone reduces the risk by
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
22 % .
O O O
Overall , in high - risk patients , warfarin is superior to aspirin in preventing strokes , with a relative risk reduction of 36 % .

Interaction of cyclosporin A with antineoplastic agents .
O O B I O O O O
A synergistic effect of etoposide and cyclosporin A was observed in a patient with acute T - lymphocytic leukemia in relapse .
O O O O B O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The concomitant administration of etoposide and cyclosporin A resulted in eradication of hitherto refractory leukemic infiltration of bone marrow .
O O O O B O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
Severe side effects in terms of mental confusion and progressive hyperbilirubinemia , however , point to an enhancement not only of antineoplastic effects but also of toxicity in normal tissues
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.

The hematologic effects of cefonicid and cefazedone in the dog : a potential model of cephalosporin hematotoxicity in man .
O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Cephalosporin antibiotics cause a variety of hematologic disturbances in man , the pathogeneses and hematopathology of which remain poorly characterized .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There is a need for a well - defined animal model in which these blood dyscrasias can be studied .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In four subacute toxicity studies , the intravenous administration of cefonicid or cefazedone to beagle dogs caused a dose - dependent incidence of anemia , neutropenia , and thrombocytopenia after
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 - 3 months of treatment .
O O O O O O O
A nonregenerative anemia was the most compromising of the cytopenias and occurred in approximately 50 % of dogs receiving 400 - 500 mg / kg cefonicid or 540 - 840
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
mg / kg cefazedone .
O O O B O
All three cytopenias were completely reversible following cessation of treatment ; the time required for recovery of the erythron ( approximately 1 month ) was considerably longer than that of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the granulocytes and platelets ( hours to a few days ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Upon rechallenge with either cephalosporin , the hematologic syndrome was reproduced in most dogs tested ; cefonicid ( but not cefazedone ) - treated dogs showed a substantially reduced induction

period ( 15 + / -
O O O O O O
5 days ) compared to that of the first exposure to the drug ( 61 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
24 days ) .
O O O O
This observation , along with the rapid rate of decline in red cell mass parameters of affected dogs , suggests that a hemolytic component complicated the red cell production problem
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and that multiple toxicologic mechanisms contributed to the cytopenia .
O O O O O O O O O O
We conclude that the administration of high doses of cefonicid or cefazedone to dogs can induce hematotoxicity similar to the cephalosporin - induced blood dyscrasias described in man and thus
O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of these disorders .

Lovastatin and simvastatin are the 2 best - known members of the class of hypolipidaemic agents known as HMG CoA reductase inhibitors .
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical experience with lovastatin includes over 5000 patients , 700 of whom have been treated for 2 years or more , and experience with simvastatin includes over 3500 patients ,
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
of whom 350 have been treated for 18 months or more .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lovastatin has been marketed in the United States for over 6 months .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both agents show substantial clinical efficacy , with reductions in total cholesterol of over 30 % and in LDL - cholesterol of 40 % in clinical studies .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Modest increases in HDL - cholesterol levels of about 10 % are also reported .

Clinical tolerability of both agents has been good , with fewer than 3 % of patients withdrawn from treatment because of clinical adverse experiences .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ophthalmological examinations in over 1100 patients treated with one or the other agent have revealed no evidence of significant short term ( up to 2 years ) cataractogenic potential .

While there is no single correct starting dose for levodopa therapy , many individuals can be started on either the 25 / 100 or controlled - release formula , following
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the general rule not to attempt to titrate carbidopa - levodopa to the point of """" normality , """" which can lead to toxicity .
O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The physician should also determine the proper use of any adjunctive medications ; such combined therapy has become the standard approach to treatment .

Alpha and beta coma in drug intoxication uncomplicated by cerebral hypoxia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Four patients who were rendered comatose or stuporous by drug intoxication , but who were not hypoxic , are described .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Three patients received high doses of chlormethiazole for alcohol withdrawal symptoms , and one took a suicidal overdose of nitrazepam .
O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O B O
The patient with nitrazepam overdose and two of those with chlormethiazole intoxication conformed to the criteria of ' alpha coma ' , showing non - reactive generalized or frontally predominant

alpha activity in the EEG .
O O O O O O
The fourth patient who was unconscious after chlormethiazole administration exhibite generalized non - reactive activity in the slow beta range .

Omitting fentanyl reduces nausea and vomiting , without increasing pain , after sevoflurane for day surgery .
O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : Despite advantages of induction and maintenance of anaesthesia with sevoflurane , postoperative nausea and vomiting occurs frequently .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Fentanyl is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this , although it may also improve analgesia .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
This double - blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain in the first 24 h after sevoflurane anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
patients .
O O
Patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 fentanyl , while a third group received dexamethasone in addition to fentanyl .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O B O
RESULTS :
O O
Omission of fentanyl did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting , but did reduce the incidence of vomiting and / or moderate to severe nausea prior
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to discharge from 20 % and 17 % with fentanyl and fentanyl - dexamethasone , respectively , to 5 % ( P = 0 . 013 ) .
O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24 % and 31 % to 7 % ( P = 0 . 0012 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Dexamethasone had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Combining the two fentanyl groups revealed further significant benefits from the avoidance of opioids , reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting and nausea prior to discharge from 35 % and 33
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
% to 22 % and 19 % ( P = 0 . 049 and P = 0 . 035 ) , respectively , while nausea in the first 24 h
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was decreased from 42 % to 27 % ( P = 0 . 034 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pain severity and analgesic requirements were unaffected by the omission of fentanyl .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Fentanyl did reduce minor intraoperative movement but had no sevoflurane - sparing effect and increased respiratory depression , hypotension and bradycardia .
B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
As fentanyl exacerbated postoperative nausea and vomiting without an improvement in postoperative pain and also had adverse cardiorespiratory effects , it appears to be an unnecessary and possibly detrimental supplement
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to sevoflurane in day surgery .

Renal Fanconi syndrome and myopathy after liver transplantation : drug - related mitochondrial cytopathy ?
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Advances in the field of transplantation provide a better quality of life and allow more favorable conditions for growth and development in children .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , combinations of different therapeutic regimens require consideration of potential adverse reactions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We describe a 15 - yr - old girl who had orthotopic liver transplantation because of Wilson 's disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Tacrolimus , MMF , and steroids were given as immunosuppressant .
B O B O O B O O O O O
Lamivudine was added because of de nova hepatitis B infection during her follow - up .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Three yr after transplantation she developed renal Fanconi syndrome with severe metabolic acidosis , hypophosphatemia , glycosuria , and aminoaciduria .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although tacrolimus was suspected to be the cause of late post - transplant renal acidosis and was replaced by sirolimus , acidosis , and electrolyte imbalance got worse .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Proximal muscle weakness has developed during her follow - up .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Fanconi syndrome , as well as myopathy , is well recognized in patients with mitochondrial disorders and caused by depletion of mtDNA .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We suggest that our patient 's tubular dysfunction and myopathy may have resulted from mitochondrial dysfunction which is triggered by tacrolimus and augmented by lamivudine .

Antipsychotic - like profile of thioperamide , a selective H3 - receptor antagonist in mice .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Experimental and clinical evidence points to a role of central histaminergic system in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The present study was designed to study the effect of histamine H ( 3 ) - receptor ligands on neuroleptic - induced catalepsy , apomorphine - induced climbing behavior and
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
amphetamine - induced locomotor activities in mice .
B O O O O O O O
Catalepsy was induced by haloperidol ( 2 mg / kg p . o . ) , while apomorphine ( 1 . 5 mg / kg s . c . )
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
and amphetamine ( 2 mg / kg s . c . ) were used for studying climbing behavior and locomotor activities , respectively .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( R ) - alpha - methylhistamine ( RAMH ) ( 5 microg i . c . v . ) and thioperamide ( THP ) (
B I I I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O
15 mg / kg i . p . )
O O O O O O O O O
, per se did not cause catalepsy .
O O O O O O O O
Administration of THP ( 3 . 75 , 7 . 5 and 15 mg / kg
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i . p . )
O O O O O
1 h prior to haloperidol resulted in a dose - dependent increase in the catalepsy times ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , pretreatment with RAMH significantly reversed such an effect of THP ( 15 mg / kg i . p . ) .
O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
RAMH per se showed significant reduction in locomotor time , distance traveled and average speed but THP ( 15 mg / kg
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
i . p . )
O O O O O
per se had no effect on these parameters .
O O O O O O O O O
On amphetamine - induced hyperactivity , THP ( 3 . 75 and 7 . 5 mg / kg i . p . ) reduced locomotor time , distance traveled and
O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
average speed ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O
Pretreatment with RAMH ( 5 microg i . c . v . ) could partially reverse such effects of THP ( 3 . 75 mg / kg i . p
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
. ) .
O O O
Climbing behavior induced by apomorphine was reduced in animals treated with THP .
O O O O B O O O O O O B O
Such an effect was , however , reversed in presence of RAMH .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O
THP exhibited an antipsychotic - like profile by potentiating haloperidol - induced catalepsy , reducing amphetamine - induced hyperactivity and reducing apomorphine - induced climbing in mice .
B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O
Such effects of THP were reversed by RAMH indicating the involvement of histamine H ( 3 ) - receptors .
O O O B O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O
Findings suggest a potential for H ( 3 ) - receptor antagonists in improving the refractory cases of schizophrenia .

Transient platypnea - orthodeoxia - like syndrome induced by propafenone overdose in a young woman with Ebstein 's anomaly .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
In this report we describe the case of a 37 - year - old white woman with Ebstein 's anomaly , who developed a rare syndrome called platypnea - orthodeoxia
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, characterized by massive right - to - left interatrial shunting with transient profound hypoxia and cyanosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This shunt of blood via a patent foramen ovale occurred in the presence of a normal pulmonary artery pressure , and was probably precipitated by a propafenone overdose .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
This drug caused biventricular dysfunction , due to its negative inotropic effect , and hypotension , due to its peripheral vasodilatory effect .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These effects gave rise to an increase in the right atrial pressure and a decrease in the left one with a consequent stretching of the foramen ovale and the creation
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of massive right - to - left shunting .
O O O O O O O O O
In our case this interatrial shunt was very accurately detected at bubble contrast echocardiography .

A Phase II trial of cisplatin plus WR - 2721 ( amifostine ) for metastatic breast carcinoma : an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study ( E8188 ) .
O O O O O B O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Cisplatin has minimal antitumor activity when used as second - or third - line treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Older reports suggest an objective response rate of 8 % when 60 - 120 mg / m2 of cisplatin is administered every 3 - 4 weeks .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Although a dose - response effect has been observed with cisplatin , the dose - limiting toxicities associated with cisplatin ( e . g . , nephrotoxicity , ototoxicity ,
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
and neurotoxicity ) have limited its use as a treatment for breast carcinoma .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
WR - 2721 or amifostine initially was developed to protect military personnel in the event of nuclear war .
B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Amifostine subsequently was shown to protect normal tissues from the toxic effects of alkylating agents and cisplatin without decreasing the antitumor effect of the chemotherapy .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O
Early trials of cisplatin and amifostine also suggested that the incidence and severity of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity , ototoxicity , and neuropathy were reduced .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
A Phase II study of the combination of cisplatin plus amifostine was conducted in patients with progressive metastatic breast carcinoma who had received one , but not more than one
O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease .
O O O O O O O
Patients received amifostine , 910 mg / m2 intravenously over 15 minutes .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O
After completion of the amifostine infusion , cisplatin 120 mg / m2 was administered over 30 minutes .
O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Intravenous hydration and mannitol was administered before and after cisplatin .
O O O B O O O O O B O
Treatment was administered every 3 weeks until disease progression .
O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Forty - four patients were enrolled in the study of which 7 ( 16 % ) were ineligible .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A median of 2 cycles of therapy was administered to the 37 eligible patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Six partial responses were observed for an overall response rate of 16 % .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Most patients ( 57 % ) stopped treatment because of disease progression .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Neurologic toxicity was reported in 52 % of patients .
O O O O O O O O O O
Seven different life - threatening toxicities were observed in patients while receiving treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
The combination of cisplatin and amifostine in this study resulted in an overall response rate of 16 % .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Neither a tumor - protective effect nor reduced toxicity to normal tissues was observed with the addition of amifostine to cisplatin in this trial .

Warfarin - induced iliopsoas hemorrhage with subsequent femoral nerve palsy .
B O O O O O O O O O O
We present the case of a 28 - year - old man on chronic warfarin therapy who sustained a minor muscle tear and developed increasing pain and a flexure contracture
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of the right hip .
O O O O O
Surgical exploration revealed an iliopsoas hematoma and femoral nerve entrapment , resulting in a femoral nerve palsy and partial loss of quadriceps functions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Anticoagulant - induced femoral nerve palsy represents the most common form of warfarin - induced peripheral neuropathy ; it is characterized by severe pain in the inguinal region , varying
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
degrees of motor and sensory impairment , and flexure contracture of the involved extremity .

Nephrotoxicity of combined cephalothin - gentamicin regimen .
O O O B O B O O
Two patients developed acute tubular necrosis , characterized clinically by acute oliguric renal failure , while they were receiving a combination of cephalothin sodium and gentamicin sulfate therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I O O
Patients who are given this drug regimen should be observed very carefully for early signs of nephrotoxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
High doses of this antibiotic combination should be avoided especially in elderly patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients with renal insufficiency should not be given this regimen .

Components of lemon essential oil attenuate dementia induced by scopolamine .
O O O O O O O O O B O
The anti - dementia effects of s - limonene and s - perillyl alcohol were observed using the passive avoidance test ( PA ) and the open field habituation test
O O O O O O B I I O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( OFH ) .
O O O O
These lemon essential oils showed strong ability to improve memory impaired by scopolamine ; however , s - perillyl alcohol relieved the deficit of associative memory in PA only ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O
and did not improve non - associative memory significantly in OFH .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Analysis of neurotransmitter concentration in some brain regions on the test day showed that dopamine concentration of the vehicle / scopolamine group was significantly lower than that of the vehicle
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
/ vehicle group , but this phenomenon was reversed when s - limonene or s - perillyl alcohol were administered before the injection of scopolamine .
O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I O O O O O O B O
Simultaneously , we found that these two lemon essential oil components could inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity in vitro using the Ellman method .

Although the underlying mechanism ( s ) are not well understood , these effects may involve an increase in acetylcholine ( ACh ) levels .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O
The present study sought to characterize the cognitive - enhancing effects of the 5 - HT ( 6 ) antagonist Ro4368554 (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B O
3 - benzenesulfonyl - 7 - ( 4 - methyl - piperazin - 1 - yl ) 1H - indole ) in a rat object recognition task employing a cholinergic

( scopolamine pretreatment ) and a serotonergic - ( tryptophan ( TRP ) depletion ) deficient model , and compared its pattern of action with that of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
O B O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
metrifonate .
B O
Initial testing in a time - dependent forgetting task employing a 24 - h delay between training and testing showed that metrifonate improved object recognition ( at 10 and 30
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
mg / kg , p . o . ) , whereas Ro4368554 was inactive .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Both , Ro4368554 ( 3 and 10 mg / kg , intraperitoneally ( i . p . ) ) and metrifonate ( 10 mg / kg , p . o
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O

O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O
, and 3 mg / kg , p . o . , respectively ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In conclusion , although Ro4368554 did not improve a time - related retention deficit , it reversed a cholinergic and a serotonergic memory deficit , suggesting that both mechanisms may
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
be involved in the facilitation of object memory by Ro4368554 and , possibly , other 5 - HT ( 6 ) receptor antagonists .

Lone atrial fibrillation associated with creatine monohydrate supplementation .
O O O O O B O O O
Atrial fibrillation in young patients without structural heart disease is rare .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , when the arrhythmia is present in this population , reversible causes must be identified and resolved .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thyroid disorders , illicit drug or stimulant use , and acute alcohol intoxication are among these causes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We report the case of a 30 - year - old Caucasian man who came to the emergency department in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
His medical history was unremarkable , except for minor fractures of the fingers and foot .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thyroid - stimulating hormone , magnesium , and potassium levels were within normal limits , urine drug screen was negative , and alcohol use was denied .
O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
However , when the patient was questioned about use of herbal products and supplements , the use of creatine monohydrate was revealed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The patient was admitted to the hospital , anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin , and given intravenous diltiazem for rate control and intravenous amiodarone for rate and rhythm control .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O
When discharged less than 24 hours later , he was receiving metoprolol and aspirin , with follow - up plans for echocardiography and nuclear imaging to assess perfusion .

Comparison of developmental toxicity of selective and non - selective cyclooxygenase - 2 inhibitors in CRL : ( WI ) WUBR Wistar rats - - DFU and piroxicam study .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Cyclooxygenase ( COX ) inhibitors are one of the most often ingested drugs during pregnancy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Unlike general toxicity data , their prenatal toxic effects were not extensively studied before .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the developmental toxicity of the non - selective ( piroxicam ) and selective ( DFU ;
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O
5 , 5 - dimethyl - 3 - ( 3 - fluorophenyl ) - 4 - ( 4 - methylsulphonyl ) phenyl - 2 ( 5H ) - furanon )

COX - 2 inhibitors .
O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Drugs were separately , orally once daily dosed to pregnant rats from day 8 to 21 ( GD1 = plug day ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Doses were set at 0 . 3 , 3 . 0 and 30 . 0mg / kg for piroxicam and 0 . 2 , 2 . 0 and 20 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
0mg / kg for DFU .
O O O O B O
Fetuses were delivered on GD 21 and routinely examined .
O O O O O O O O O O
Comprehensive clinical and developmental measurements were done .
O O O O O O O O
The pooled statistical analysis for ventricular septal ( VSD ) and midline ( MD ) defects was performed for rat fetuses exposed to piroxicam , selective and non - selective
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
COX - 2 inhibitor based on present and historic data .
O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Maternal toxicity , intrauterine growth retardation , and increase of external and skeletal variations were found in rats treated with the highest dose of piroxicam .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Decrease of fetal length was the only signs of the DFU developmental toxicity observed in pups exposed to the highest compound dose .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lack of teratogenicity was found in piroxicam and DFU - exposed groups .
O O O O O O B O B O O O O
Prenatal exposure to non - selective COX inhibitors increases the risk of VSD and MD when compared to historic control but not with selective COX - 2 inhibitors .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Both selective and non - selective COX - 2 inhibitors were toxic for rats fetuses when administered in the highest dose .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Unlike DFU , piroxicam was also highly toxic to the dams .

O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They offer protection against seizures in a range of models and seem to inhibit certain stages of drug dependence in preclinical assessments .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The present study was designed to evaluate two endogenous and one synthetic neuroactive steroid that positively modulate the gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ( A ) ) receptor against
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B I I I O B O O O O O O
the increase in sensitivity to the convulsant effects of cocaine engendered by repeated cocaine administration ( seizure kindling ) .

Allopregnanolone ( 3alpha - hydroxy - 5alpha - pregnan - 20 - one ) , pregnanolone ( 3alpha - hydroxy - 5beta - pregnan - 20 - one ) and
B O B I I I I I I I I I I O O B O B I I I I I I I I I I O O
ganaxolone ( a synthetic derivative of allopregnanolone 3alpha - hydroxy - 3beta - methyl - 5alpha - pregnan - 20 - one ) were tested for their ability to suppress
B O O O O O B B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O
the expression ( anticonvulsant effect ) and development ( antiepileptogenic effect ) of cocaine - kindled seizures in male , Swiss - Webster mice .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Kindled seizures were induced by daily administration of 60 mg / kg cocaine for 5 days .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
All of these positive GABA ( A ) modulators suppressed the expression of kindled seizures , whereas only allopregnanolone and ganaxolone inhibited the development of kindling .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O
Allopregnanolone and pregnanolone , but not ganaxolone , also reduced cumulative lethality associated with kindling .
B O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O
These findings demonstrate that some neuroactive steroids attenuate convulsant and sensitizing properties of cocaine and add to a growing literature on their potential use in the modulation of effects of

Kidney function and morphology after short - term combination therapy with cyclosporine A , tacrolimus and sirolimus in the rat .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O B O O O O
BACKGROUND : Sirolimus ( SRL ) may supplement calcineurin inhibitors in clinical organ transplantation .
O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
These are nephrotoxic , but SRL seems to act differently displaying only minor nephrotoxic effects , although this question is still open .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In a number of treatment protocols where SRL was combined with a calcineurin inhibitor indications of a synergistic nephrotoxic effect were described .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The aim of this study was to examine further the renal function , including morphological analysis of the kidneys of male Sprague - Dawley rats treated with either
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cyclosporine A ( CsA ) , tacrolimus ( FK506 ) or SRL as monotherapies or in different combinations .
B I O B O O B O B O O B O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
For a period of 2 weeks , CsA 15 mg / kg / day ( given orally ) , FK506 3 . 0 mg / kg / day ( given
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
orally ) or SRL 0 . 4 mg / kg / day ( given intraperitoneally ) was administered once a day as these doses have earlier been found to achieve
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a significant immunosuppressive effect in Sprague - Dawley rats .
O O O O O O O O O O
In the ' conscious catheterized rat ' model , the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) was measured as the clearance of Cr ( EDTA ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The morphological analysis of the kidneys included a semi - quantitative scoring system analysing the degree of striped fibrosis , subcapsular fibrosis and the number of basophilic tubules , plus
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
an additional stereological analysis of the total grade of fibrosis in the cortex stained with Sirius Red .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS : CsA , FK506 and SRL
O O B O B O B
all significantly decreased the GFR .
O O O O O O
A further deterioration was seen when CsA was combined with either FK506 or SRL , whereas the GFR remained unchanged in the group treated with FK506 plus SRL when compared
O O O O O O B O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O
with treatment with any of the single substances .
O O O O O O O O O
The morphological changes presented a similar pattern .
O O O O O O O O
The semi - quantitative scoring was significantly worst in the group treated with CsA plus SRL ( P < 0 . 001 compared with controls ) and the analysis of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the total grade of fibrosis also showed the highest proportion in the same group and was significantly different from controls ( P < 0 . 02 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The FK506 plus SRL combination showed only a marginally higher degree of fibrosis as compared with controls ( P = 0 . 05 ) .
O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
This rat study demonstrated a synergistic nephrotoxic effect of CsA plus SRL , whereas FK506 plus SRL was better tolerated .

Effect of fucoidan treatment on collagenase - induced intracerebral hemorrhage in rats .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Inflammatory cells are postulated to mediate some of the brain damage following ischemic stroke .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Intracerebral hemorrhage is associated with more inflammation than ischemic stroke .
O O O O O O O O O O O
We tested the sulfated polysaccharide fucoidan , which has been reported to reduce inflammatory brain damage , in a rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage induced by injection of bacterial collagenase
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
into the caudate nucleus .
O O O O O
Rats were treated with seven day intravenous infusion of fucoidan ( 30 micrograms h - 1 ) or vehicle .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
The hematoma was assessed in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Motor behavior , passive avoidance , and skilled forelimb function were tested repeatedly for six weeks .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fucoidan - treated rats exhibited evidence of impaired blood clotting and hemodilution , had larger hematomas , and tended to have less inflammation in the vicinity of the hematoma after
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
three days .
O O O
They showed significantly more rapid improvement of motor function in the first week following hemorrhage and better memory retention in the passive avoidance test .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Acute white matter edema and eventual neuronal loss in the striatum adjacent to the hematoma did not differ between the two groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Investigation of more specific anti - inflammatory agents and hemodiluting agents are warranted in intracerebral hemorrhage .

Hepatic reactions associated with ketoconazole in the United Kingdom .
O O O O B O O O O O
Ketoconazole was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1981 .
B O O O O O O O O O
By November 1984 the Committee on Safety of Medicines had received 82 reports of possible hepatotoxicity associated with the drug , including five deaths .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An analysis of the 75 cases that had been adequately followed up suggested that 16 , including three deaths , were probably related to treatment with the drug .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of the remainder , 48 were possibly related to treatment , five were unlikely to be so , and six were unclassifiable .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mean age of patients in the 16 probable cases was 57 . 9 , with hepatotoxicity being more common in women .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The average duration of treatment before the onset of jaundice was 61 days .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
None of these well validated cases occurred within the first 10 days after treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results of serum liver function tests suggested hepatocellular injury in 10 ( 63 % ) ; the rest showed a mixed pattern .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , the results of histological examination of the liver often showed evidence of cholestasis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The characteristics of the 48 patients in the possible cases were similar .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Allergic manifestations such as rash and eosinophilia were rare .
O O O O O O O O O O
Hepatitis was usually reversible when treatment was stopped , with the results of liver function tests returning to normal after an average of 3 . 1 months .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In two of the three deaths probably associated with ketoconazole treatment the drug had been continued after the onset of jaundice and other symptoms of hepatitis .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical and biochemical monitoring at regular intervals for evidence of hepatitis is advised during long term treatment with ketoconazole to prevent possible serious hepatic injury .

Combined effects of prolonged prostaglandin E1 - induced hypotension and haemodilution on human hepatic function .
O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
Combined effects of prolonged prostaglandin E1 ( PGE1 ) - induced hypotension and haemodilution on hepatic function were studied in 30 patients undergoing hip surgery .
O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups ; those in group A ( n = 10 ) were subjected to controlled hypotension alone , those in group
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
B ( n = 10 ) to haemodilution alone and those in group C ( n = 10 ) to both controlled hypotension and haemodilution .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Haemodilution in groups B and C was produced by withdrawing approximately 1000 mL of blood and replacing it with the same amount of dextran solution , and final haematocrit values
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
were 21 or 22 % .
O O O O O O
Controlled hypotension in groups A and C was induced with PGE1 to maintain mean arterial blood pressure at 55 mmHg for 180 min .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Measurements included arterial ketone body ratio ( AKBR , aceto - acetate / 3 - hydroxybutyrate ) and clinical hepatic function parameters .
O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O
AKBR and biological hepatic function tests showed no change throughout the time course in groups A and B .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In group C , AKBR showed a significant decrease at 120 min ( - 40 % ) and at 180 min ( - 49 % ) after the start of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hypotension and at 60 min ( - 32 % ) after recovery of normotension , and SGOT , SGPT , LDH and total bilirubin showed significant increases after operation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The results suggest that a prolonged combination of more than 120 min of PGE1 - induced hypotension and moderate haemodilution would cause impairment of hepatic function .

Levodopa - induced dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson 's disease : filling the bench - to - bedside gap .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Levodopa is the most effective drug for the treatment of Parkinson 's disease .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , the long - term use of this dopamine precursor is complicated by highly disabling fluctuations and dyskinesias .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Although preclinical and clinical findings suggest pulsatile stimulation of striatal postsynaptic receptors as a key mechanism underlying levodopa - induced dyskinesias , their pathogenesis is still unclear .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
In recent years , evidence from animal models of Parkinson 's disease has provided important information to understand the effect of specific receptor and post - receptor molecular mechanisms underlying
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the development of dyskinetic movements .
O O O O O O
Recent preclinical and clinical data from promising lines of research focus on the differential role of presynaptic versus postsynaptic mechanisms , dopamine receptor subtypes , ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O
, and non - dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems in the pathophysiology of levodopa - induced dyskinesias .

Prevention of seizures and reorganization of hippocampal functions by transplantation of bone marrow cells in the acute phase of experimental epilepsy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this study , we investigated the therapeutic potential of bone marrow mononuclear cells ( BMCs ) in a model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine in rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
BMCs obtained from green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) transgenic mice or rats were transplanted intravenously after induction of status epilepticus ( SE ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Spontaneous recurrent seizures ( SRS ) were monitored using Racine 's seizure severity scale .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All of the rats in the saline - treated epileptic control group developed SRS , whereas none of the BMC - treated epileptic animals had seizures in the short term
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( 15 days after transplantation ) , regardless of the BMC source .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Over the long - term chronic phase ( 120 days after transplantation ) , only 25 % of BMC - treated epileptic animals had seizures , but with a lower
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
frequency and duration compared to the epileptic control group .
O O O O O O O O O O
The density of hippocampal neurons in the brains of animals treated with BMCs was markedly preserved .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At hippocampal Schaeffer collateral - CA1 synapses , long - term potentiation was preserved in BMC - transplanted rats compared to epileptic controls .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The donor - derived GFP ( + ) cells were rarely found in the brains of transplanted epileptic rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In conclusion , treatment with BMCs can prevent the development of chronic seizures , reduce neuronal loss , and influence the reorganization of the hippocampal neuronal network .

Cardioprotective effect of salvianolic acid A on isoproterenol - induced myocardial infarction in rats .
O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O
The present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of salvianolic acid A on isoproterenol - induced myocardial infarction in rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O
Hemodynamic parameters and lead II electrocardiograph were monitored and recorded continuously .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cardiac marker enzymes and antioxidative parameters in serum and heart tissues were measured .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Assay for mitochondrial respiratory function and histopathological examination of heart tissues were performed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Isoproterenol - treated rats showed significant increases in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase , aspartate transaminase , creatine kinase and malondialdehyde and significant decreases in the activities of superoxide dismutase
B O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O B O O B O O O O O O O B O
, catalase and glutathione peroxidase in serum and heart .
O O O B O O O O O O
These rats also showed declines in left ventricular systolic pressure , maximum and minimum rate of developed left ventricular pressure , and elevation of left ventricular end - diastolic pressure
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and ST - segment .
O O O O O
In addition , mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction characterized by decreased respiratory control ratio and ADP / O was observed in isoproterenol - treated rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O
Administration of salvianolic acid A for a period of 8 days significantly attenuated isoproterenol - induced cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury and improved mitochondrial respiratory function .
O O B I I O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The protective role of salvianolic acid A against isoproterenol - induced myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination .
O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O
The results of our study suggest that salvianolic acid A possessing antioxidant activity has a significant protective effect against isoproterenol - induced myocardial infarction .

Acute effects of N - ( 2 - propylpentanoyl ) urea on hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters in pilocarpine - induced seizure in rats .
O O O B I I I I I I I O O B I O O B O O O O O O
The present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters ( glutamate , aspartate , glycine and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B O B O B O
GABA ) of N - ( 2 - propylpentanoyl ) urea ( VPU ) in comparison to its parent compound , valproic acid ( VPA ) .
B O O B I I I I I I I O B O O O O O O O O B I O B O O
VPU was more potent than VPA , exhibiting the median effective dose ( ED ( 50 ) ) of 49 mg / kg in protecting rats against pilocarpine - induced
B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
seizure whereas the corresponding value for VPA was 322 mg / kg .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O
In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal glutamate and aspartate whereas no significant change was observed on the level of
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
glycine and GABA .
B O B O
Pretreatment with either VPU ( 50 and 100 mg / kg ) or VPA ( 300 and 600 mg / kg ) completely abolished pilocarpine - evoked increases in extracellular
O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
glutamate and aspartate .
B O B O
In addition , a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of GABA and glycine but less than a drastic reduction of glutamate and aspartate level .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O B O B O O
Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect the animals against pilocarpine - induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was comparatively
O O O O O B O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O
minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspartate .
O O O O O O O O B O B O
Therefore , like VPA , the finding that VPU could drastically reduce pilocarpine - induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should account , at least partly , for its anticonvulsant
O O O B O O O O B O O O B O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
activity observed in pilocarpine - induced seizure in experimental animals .
O O O B O O O O O O O
Some other mechanism than those being reported herein should be further investigated .

Acute hepatitis attack after exposure to telithromycin .
O O O O O O B O
INTRODUCTION :
O O
Antibiotic - associated hepatotoxicity is rare .
O O O O O O O
With widespread use of antimicrobial agents , however , hepatic injury occurs frequently , and among adverse drug reactions , idiosyncratic reactions are the most serious .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CASE SUMMARY :
O O O
A 25 - year - old male patient , with a height of 175 cm and weight of 72 kg presented to Marmara University Hospital Emergency Department , Istanbul ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Turkey , with 5 days ' history of jaundice , malaise , nausea , and vomiting .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He had been prescribed telithromycin 400 mg / d PO to treat an upper respiratory tract infection 7 days prior .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Admission laboratory tests were as follows :
O O O O O O O
alanine aminotransferase , 67 U / L ( reference range , 10 - 37 U / L ) ; aspartate aminotransferase , 98 U / L ( 10 - 40
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
U / L ) ; alkaline phosphatase , 513 U / L ( 0 - 270 U / L ) ; gamma - glutamyltransferase , 32 U / L (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
7 - 49 U / L ) ; amylase , 46 U / L ( 0 - 220 U / L ) ; total bilirubin , 20 . 1 mg
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
/ dL ( 0 . 2 - 1 . 0 mg / dL ) ; direct bilirubin , 14 . 8 mg / dL
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
( 0 - 0 . 3 mg / dL ) ; and albumin , 4 . 7 mg / dL ( 3 . 5 - 5 . 4 mg /
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dL ) .
O O O
No toxin , alcohol , or other drugs were reported .
O O O B O O O O O O O
The patient had suffered a previous episode of """" acute hepatitis of unknown origin , """" that occurred after telithromycin usage .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Both incidents occurred within a year .
O O O O O O O
DISCUSSION :
O O
Telithromycin is the first of the ketolide antibacterials to receive US Food and Drug Administration approval for clinical use .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It has been associated with infrequent and usually reversible severe hepatic dysfunction .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Based on a score of 8 on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale , telithromycin was the probable cause of acute hepatitis in this patient , and pathological findings
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
suggested drug - induced toxic hepatitis .
O O O O O O O
Recurrence of hepatitis attack might have been avoided if the initial incident had been communicated to the attending physician who prescribed telithromycin the second time .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Here we report a case of acute hepatitis probably associated with the administration of telithromycin .

Spironolactone - induced renal insufficiency and hyperkalemia in patients with heart failure .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
A previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of spironolactone in heart failure patients reported a low risk of hyperkalemia ( 2 % ) and renal insufficiency ( 0 %
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) .
O O
Because treatments for heart failure have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported , the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
METHODS :
O O
We performed a case control study of heart failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practice .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Cases were patients who developed hyperkalemia ( K ( + ) > 5 . 0 mEq / L ) or renal insufficiency ( Cr > or = 2 . 5
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
mg / dL ) , and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical characteristics , medications , and serum chemistries at baseline and follow - up time periods were compared .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Sixty - seven of 926 patients ( 7 . 2 % ) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia ( n = 33 ) or renal failure ( n =
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
34 ) .
O O O
Patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes , had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses , and were more likely
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O
to be treated with beta - blockers than controls ( n = 134 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients who developed renal insufficiency had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum creatinine , required higher doses of loop diuretics , and were more likely to be treated
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with thiazide diuretics than controls .
O B O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Spironolactone - induced hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency are more common in our clinical experience than reported previously .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This difference is explained by patient comorbidities and more frequent use of beta - blockers .

BACKGROUND :
O O
The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both known to be nephrotoxic .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O
Their use in orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLTX ) has dramatically improved success rates .

Recently , however , we have had an increase of patients who are presenting after OLTX with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of ESRD and chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in OLTX patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Patients receiving an OLTX only from June 1985 through December of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied ( n = 834 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our prospectively collected database was the source of information .
O O O O O O O O O O
Patients were divided into three groups : Controls , no CRF or ESRD , n = 748 ; CRF , sustained serum creatinine > 2 . 5 mg / dl
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
, n = 41 ; and ESRD , n = 45 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables , diagnosis , postoperative variables , survival , type of ESRD therapy , and survival from onset of ESRD .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
At 13 years after OLTX , the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18 . 1 % ( CRF 8 . 6 % and ESRD 9 . 5 % )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Compared with control patients , CRF and ESRD patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels , a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome , higher percentage requirement for dialysis
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the first 3 months postoperatively , and a higher 1 - year serum creatinine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year , 3 months , and 4 weeks
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of CRF or ESRD with odds ratios of 2 . 6 , 2 . 2 , and 1 . 6 , respectively
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different among groups , but by year 13 , the survival of the patients who had ESRD was only 28
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
. 2 % compared with 54 . 6 % in the control group .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients developing ESRD had a 6 - year survival after onset of ESRD of 27 % for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71 . 4 % for the patients developing
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ESRD who subsequently received kidney transplants .
O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Patients who are more than 10 years post - OLTX have CRF and ESRD at a high rate .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The development of ESRD decreases survival , particularly in those patients treated with dialysis only .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients who develop ESRD have a higher preoperative and 1 - year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
However , an increase of serum creatinine at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of CRF or ESRD .

New strategies for long - term immunosuppression may be needed to decrease this complication .

Effect of intravenous nimodipine on blood pressure and outcome after acute stroke .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE :
O O O O
The Intravenous Nimodipine West European Stroke Trial ( INWEST ) found a correlation between nimodipine - induced reduction in blood pressure ( BP ) and an unfavorable outcome in acute
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
stroke .
O O
We sought to confirm this correlation with and without adjustment for prognostic variables and to investigate outcome in subgroups with increasing levels of BP reduction .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke ( within 24 hours ) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo ( n = 100 ) , 1 mg / h (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
low - dose ) nimodipine ( n = 101 ) , or 2 mg / h ( high - dose ) nimodipine ( n = 94 ) .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The correlation between average BP change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analyzed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Two hundred sixty - five patients were included in this analysis ( n = 92 , 93 , and 80 for placebo , low dose , and high dose ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
respectively ) .
O O O
Nimodipine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in systolic BP ( SBP ) and diastolic BP ( DBP ) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
In multivariate analysis , a significant correlation between DBP reduction and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high - dose group ( beta = 0 . 49
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, P = 0 . 048 ) .
O O O O O O O O
Patients with a DBP reduction of > or = 20 % in the high - dose group had a significantly increased adjusted OR for the compound outcome variable death or
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dependency ( Barthel Index < 60 ) ( n / N = 25 / 26 , OR 10 . 16 , 95 % CI 1 . 02 to 101 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
74 ) and death alone ( n / N = 9 / 26 , OR 4 . 336 , 95 % CI 1 . 131 16 . 619 ) compared
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with all placebo patients ( n / N = 62 / 92 and 14 / 92 , respectively ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was no correlation between SBP change and outcome .
O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS : DBP , but not SBP ,
O O O O O O O O
reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high - dose nimodipine after acute stroke .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
For low - dose nimodipine , the results were not conclusive .
O O O O B O O O O O O O
These results do not confirm or exclude a neuroprotective property of nimodipine .

Transient neurologic symptoms after spinal anesthesia : a lower incidence with prilocaine and bupivacaine than with lidocaine .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O B O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Recent evidence suggests that transient neurologic symptoms ( TNSs ) frequently follow lidocaine spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with bupivacaine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O
However , identification of a short - acting local anesthetic to substitute for lidocaine for brief surgical procedures remains an important goal .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Prilocaine is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of lidocaine .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Accordingly , the present , prospective double - blind study compares prilocaine with lidocaine and bupivacaine with respect to duration of action and relative risk of TNSs .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Ninety patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status
O O O O O O O O O O
I or II who were scheduled for short gynecologic procedures under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 2 . 5 ml 2 % lidocaine in 7 . 5 %
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
glucose , 2 % prilocaine in 7 . 5 % glucose , or 0 . 5 % bupivacaine in 7 . 5 % glucose .
B O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O B O
All solutions were provided in blinded vials by the hospital pharmacy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Details of spinal puncture , extension and regression of spinal block , and the times to reach discharge criteria were noted .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the evening of postoperative day 1 , patients were evaluated for TNSs by a physician unaware of the drug administered and the details of the anesthetic procedure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Nine of 30 patients receiving lidocaine experienced TNSs , 1 of 30 patients receiving prilocaine ( P = 0 . 03 ) had them , and none of 30 patients
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
receiving bupivacaine had TNSs .
O B O O O
Times to ambulate and to void were similar after lidocaine and prilocaine ( 150 vs . 165 min and 238 vs . 253 min , respectively ) but prolonged after
O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bupivacaine ( 200 and 299 min , respectively ; P < 0 . 05 ) .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Prilocaine may be preferable to lidocaine for short surgical procedures because it has a similar duration of action but a lower incidence of TNSs .

The role of nicotine in smoking - related cardiovascular disease .
O O O B O O O O O O O
Nicotine activates the sympathetic nervous system and in this way could contribute to cardiovascular disease .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Animal studies and mechanistic studies indicate that nicotine could play a role in accelerating atherosclerosis , but evidence among humans is too inadequate to be definitive about such an effect
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Almost certainly , nicotine via its hemodynamic effects contributes to acute cardiovascular events , although current evidence suggests that the effects of nicotine are much less important than are the
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
prothrombotic effects of cigarette smoking or the effects of carbon monoxide .
O O O O O O O O O B I O
Nicotine does not appear to enhance thrombosis among humans .
B O O O O O O O O O
Clinical studies of pipe smokers and people using transdermal nicotine support the idea that toxins other than nicotine are the most important causes of acute cardiovascular events .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Finally , the dose response for cardiovascular events of nicotine appears to be flat , suggesting that if nicotine is involved , adverse effects might be seen with relatively low
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
- level cigarette exposures .

Seizure resulting from a venlafaxine overdose .
O O O O B O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To report a case of venlafaxine overdose .
O O O O O B O O
CASE SUMMARY :
O O O
A 40 - year - old woman with major depression took an overdose of venlafaxine in an apparent suicide attempt .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
After the ingestion of 26 venlafaxine 50 - mg tablets , the patient experienced a witnessed generalized seizure .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit , venlafaxine was discontinued , and no further sequelae were seen .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
DISCUSSION :
O O
To our knowledge , this is the first reported case of venlafaxine overdose that resulted in a generalized seizure .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Based on nonoverdose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of venlafaxine and the potential risks of available interventions , no emergent therapy was instituted .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
The venlafaxine overdose in our patient resulted in a single episode of generalized seizure but elicited no further sequelae .

Effect of nifedipine on renal function in liver transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus .
O O B O O O O O O O O B O
The effect of nifedipine on renal function in liver transplant recipients who were receiving tacrolimus was evaluated between January 1992 and January 1996 .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Two groups of patients receiving tacrolimus were compared over a period of 1 year , one group comprising hypertensive patients who were receiving nifedipine , and the other comprising nonhypertensive
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
patients not receiving nifedipine .
O O O B O
The time from transplant to baseline was similar in all patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nifedipine significantly improved kidney function as indicated by a significant lowering of serum creatinine levels at 6 and 12 months .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The observed positive impact of nifedipine on reducing the nephrotoxicity associated with tacrolimus in liver transplant recipients should be an important factor in selecting an agent to treat hypertension in
O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this population .

Sinus arrest associated with continuous - infusion cimetidine .
O O O O O O O B O
The administration of intermittent intravenous infusions of cimetidine is infrequently associated with the development of bradyarrhythmias .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
A 40 - year - old man with leukemia and no history of cardiac disease developed recurrent , brief episodes of apparent sinus arrest while receiving continuous - infusion
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cimetidine 50 mg / hour .
B O O O O O
The arrhythmias were temporally related to cimetidine administration , disappeared after dechallenge , and did not recur during ranitidine treatment .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
This is the first reported case of sinus arrest associated with continuous - infusion cimetidine .

Composition of gall bladder stones associated with octreotide : response to oral ursodeoxycholic acid .
O O O O O O O B O O O O B I O
Octreotide , an effective treatment for acromegaly , induces gall bladder stones in 13 - 60 % of patients .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because knowledge of stone composition is essential for studies of their pathogenesis , treatment , and prevention , this was investigated by direct and indirect methods in 14 octreotide treated
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
acromegalic patients with gall stones .
O O O O O O
Chemical analysis of gall stones retrieved at cholecystectomy from two patients , showed that they contained 71 % and 87 % cholesterol by weight .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
In the remaining 12 patients , localised computed tomography of the gall bladder showed that eight had stones with maximum attenuation scores of < 100 Hounsfield units ( values of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
< 100 HU predict cholesterol rich , dissolvable stones ) .
O O O O B O O O O O O
Gall bladder bile was obtained by ultrasound guided , fine needle puncture from six patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All six patients had supersaturated bile ( mean ( SEM ) cholesterol saturation index of 1 . 19 ( 0 . 08 ) ( range 1 . 01 - 1
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
. 53 ) ) and all had abnormally rapid cholesterol microcrystal nucleation times ( < 4 days ( range 1 - 4 ) ) , whilst in four , the
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bile contained cholesterol microcrystals immediately after sampling .
O O B O O O O O
Of the 12 patients considered for oral ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) treatment , two had a blocked cystic duct and were not started on UDCA while one was lost
O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
to follow up .
O O O O
After one year of treatment , five of the remaining nine patients showed either partial ( n = 3 ) or complete ( n = 2 ) gall stone dissolution
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, suggesting that their stones were cholesterol rich .
O O O O O O B O O
This corresponds , by actuarial ( life table ) analysis , to a combined gall stone dissolution rate of 58 . 3 ( 15 . 9 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In conclusion , octreotide induced gall stones are generally small , multiple , and cholesterol rich although , in common with spontaneous gall stone disease , at presentation some patients
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
will have a blocked cystic duct and some gall stones containing calcium .

Cardiovascular complications associated with terbutaline treatment for preterm labor .
O O O O B O O O O O
Severe cardiovascular complications occurred in eight of 160 patients treated with terbutaline for preterm labor .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Associated corticosteroid therapy and twin gestations appear to be predisposing factors .

Neurologic effects of subarachnoid administration of 2 - chloroprocaine - CE , bupivacaine , and low pH normal saline in dogs .
O O O O O O B I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the neurologic consequences of deliberate subarachnoid injection of large volumes of 2 - chloroprocaine - CE in experimental animals .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O
The possible role of low pH as well as total volume as potential factors in causing neurotoxicity was evaluated .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The 65 dogs in the study received injections in the subarachnoid space as follows : 6 to 8 ml of bupivacaine ( N = 15 ) ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
2 - chloroprocaine - CE ( N = 20 ) , low pH normal saline ( pH 3 . 0 )
B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( N = 20 ) , or normal saline ( N = 10 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of the 20 animals that received subarachnoid injection of 2 - chloroprocaine - CE seven ( 35 % ) developed hind - limb paralysis .
O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
None of the animals that received bupivacaine , normal saline , or normal saline titrated to a pH 3 . 0 developed hind - limb paralysis .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of the 15 spinal cords of the animals that received 2 - chloroprocaine - CE , 13 showed subpial necrosis ; the nerve roots and subarachnoid vessels were normal .
O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The spinal cords of the animals that received bupivacaine , low pH normal saline ( pH 3 . 0 ) , or normal saline did not show abnormal findings .

Early adjuvant adriamycin in superficial bladder carcinoma .
O O B O O O O O
A multicenter study was performed in 110 patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Adriamycin ( 50 mg / 50 ml ) was administered intravesically within 24 h after transurethral resection of TA - T1 ( O - A ) bladder tumors .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Instillation was repeated twice during the first week , then weekly during the first month and afterwards monthly for 1 year .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The tolerance was evaluated in these 110 patients , and 29 patients presented with local side - effects .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 24 of these patients chemical cystitis was severe enough for them to drop out of the study .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No systemic side - effects were observed .
O O O O O O O O
Recurrence was studied in 82 evaluable patients after 1 year of follow - up and in 72 patients followed for 2 - 3 years ( mean 32 months ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of the 82 patients studied after 1 year , 23 had primary and 59 recurrent disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of the 82 evaluable patients , 50 did not show any recurrence after 1 year ( 61 % ) , while 32 presented with one or more recurrences ( 39
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
% ) .
O O O
Of these recurrences , 27 were T1 tumors while five progressed to more highly invasive lesions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In patients that were free of recurrence during the first year , 80 % remained tumor - free during the 2 - to 3 - year follow - up period
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Of the patients developing one or more recurrences during the first year , only 50 % presented with further recurrence once the instillations were stopped .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The beneficial effect of Adriamycin appears obvious and might be related to the drug itself , the early and repeated instillations after TUR , or both .

Hyperkalemia associated with sulindac therapy .
O O O B O O
Hyperkalemia has recently been recognized as a complication of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents ( NSAID ) such as indomethacin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Several recent studies have stressed the renal sparing features of sulindac , owing to its lack of interference with renal prostacyclin synthesis .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O
We describe 4 patients in whom hyperkalemia ranging from 6 . 1 to 6 . 9 mEq / l developed within 3 to 8 days of sulindac administration .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
In all of them normal serum potassium levels reached within 2 to 4 days of stopping sulindac .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O
As no other medications known to effect serum potassium had been given concomitantly , this course of events is suggestive of a cause - and - effect relationship between
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sulindac and hyperkalemia .
B O O O
These observations indicate that initial hopes that sulindac may not be associated with the adverse renal effects of other NSAID are probably not justified .

Ventricular tachyarrhythmias during cesarean section after ritodrine therapy : interaction with anesthetics .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O
This case illustrates that patients receiving ritodrine for preterm labor may risk interactions between the residual betamimetic effects of ritodrine and the effects of anesthetics during cesarean section .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Such interactions may result in serious cardiovascular complications even after cessation of an infusion of ritodrine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Preoperative assessment should focus on cardiovascular status and serum potassium level .
O O O O O O O O O B O O
Delaying induction of anesthesia should be considered whenever possible .
O O O O O O O O O O
Careful fluid administration and cautious use of titrated doses of ephedrine are advised .

Immunohistochemical , electron microscopic and morphometric studies of estrogen - induced rat prolactinomas after bromocriptine treatment .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O
To clarify the effects of bromocriptine on prolactinoma cells in vivo , immunohistochemical , ultrastructural and morphometrical analyses were applied to estrogen - induced rat prolactinoma cells 1 h and
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
6 h after injection of bromocriptine ( 3 mg / kg of body weight ) .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
One h after treatment , serum prolactin levels decreased markedly .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Electron microscopy disclosed many secretory granules , slightly distorted rough endoplasmic reticulum , and partially dilated Golgi cisternae in the prolactinoma cells .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Morphometric analysis revealed that the volume density of secretory granules increased , while the volume density of cytoplasmic microtubules decreased .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings suggest that lowered serum prolactin levels in the early phase of bromocriptine treatment may result from an impaired secretion of prolactin due to decreasing numbers of cytoplasmic microtubules
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
At 6 h after injection , serum prolactin levels were still considerably lower than in controls .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The prolactinoma cells at this time were well granulated , with vesiculated rough endoplasmic reticulum and markedly dilated Golgi cisternae .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Electron microscopical immunohistochemistry revealed positive reaction products noted on the secretory granules , Golgi cisternae , and endoplasmic reticulum of the untreated rat prolactinoma cells .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , only secretory granules showed the positive reaction products for prolactin 6 h after bromocriptine treatment of the adenoma cells .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
An increase in the volume density of secretory granules and a decrease in the volume densities of rough endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules was determined by morphometric analysis , suggesting that

bromocriptine inhibits protein synthesis as well as bringing about a disturbance of the prolactin secretion .

On two paradoxical side - effects of prednisolone in rats , ribosomal RNA biosyntheses , and a mechanism of action .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Liver enlargement and muscle wastage occurred in Wistar rats following the subcutaneous administration of prednisolone .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
In the liver both the content of RNA and the biosynthesis of ribosomal RNA increased while both the RNA content and ribosomal RNA biosynthesis were reduced in the gastrocnemius muscle
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.

It is suggested that the drug acted in a selective and tissue - specific manner to enhance ribosomal RNA synthesis in the liver and depress such synthesis in the muscle
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.

This view supports the contention that the liver and muscle are independent sites of prednisolone action .

Seizures induced by the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine in rats .
O O O O B O B O O O
The half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of cocaine is relatively short , but some of the consequences of its use , such as seizures and strokes ,
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
can occur hours after exposure .
O O O O O O
This led us to hypothesize that a metabolite of cocaine may be responsible for some of those delayed sequelae .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
We evaluated the potential of the major metabolite of cocaine , benzoylecgonine ( BE ) , to cause seizures .
O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O O O O
Two separate equimolar doses ( 0 . 2 and 0 . 4 mumol ) of either cocaine or BE were injected ventricularly in unanesthetized juvenile rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O
Treated rats were then evaluated for incidence , latency , and seizure pattern or for locomotor activity in animals without seizures .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BE - Induced seizures occurred more frequently and had significantly longer latencies than those induced by equimolar amounts of cocaine .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Whereas cocaine - induced seizures were best characterized as brief , generalized , and tonic and resulted in death , those induced by BE were prolonged , often multiple and
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
mixed in type , and rarely resulted in death .
O O O O O O O O O O
Electrical recordings from the hippocampus showed a rhythmic progression in EEG frequency and voltage with clinical seizure expression .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BE - Injected rats that did not have seizures had significantly more locomotor activity than cocaine - injected animals without seizures .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The finding that cocaine - and BE - induced seizures differ in several respects suggests more than one mechanism for cocaine - induced seizures and emphasizes the importance of a

B O B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I
carboxylic acid , has been described as a potent antagonist of the N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) subtype of glutamate receptor .
I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O B O O O B O O
Here its ability to antagonize the prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum by amphetamine in iprindole - treated rats is reported .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O B O O O O O O
A single 18 . 4 mg / kg ( i . p . ) dose of ( + / - ) - amphetamine hemisulfate , given to rats pretreated with
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
iprindole , resulted in persistent depletion of dopamine in the striatum 1 week later .
B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
This prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum was antagonized by dizocilpine ( MK - 801 , a non - competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors ) or by LY274614 (
O O O O B O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O O O B O O O O B O
a competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors ) .
O O O O B O O O
The protective effect of LY274614 was dose - dependent , being maximum at 10 - 40 mgkg ( i . p . ) .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 10 mg / kg dose of LY274614 was effective in antagonizing the depletion of dopamine in the striatum , when given as long as 8 hr prior to
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
amphetamine but not when given 24 hr prior to amphetamine .
B O O O O O O O O B O
Depletion of dopamine in the striatum was also antagonized when LY274614 was given after the injection of amphetamine ; LY274614 protected when given up to 4 hr after but not
O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
when given 8 or 24 hr after amphetamine .
O O O O O O O B O
The prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum in mice , given multiple injections of methamphetamine , was also antagonized dose - dependently and completely by LY274614 .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O
The data strengthen the evidence that the neurotoxic effect of amphetamine and related compounds toward nigrostriatal dopamine neurons involves NMDA receptors and that LY274614 is an NMDA receptor antagonist with
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O B O O O B O O B O O O
long - lasting in vivo effects in rats .

B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Our study was designed to determine the effects of combined nitroglycerin and phenylephrine therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O
Ten patients with acute transmural myocardial infarctions received intravenous nitroglycerin , sufficient to reduce mean arterial pressure from 107 + / -

2 mm Hg ( P less than 0 . 05 ) and also significantly increased sigmaST ( P less than 0 . 05 ) .

This study was designed to establish a rat model of thoracic aortic aneurysm ( TAA ) by calcium chloride ( CaCl ( 2 ) ) - induced arterial injury and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I I O O O O O O
to explore the potential role of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase ( ADAM ) , matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) and their endogenous inhibitors ( TIMPs ) in TAA formation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Thoracic aorta of male Sprague - Dawley rats was exposed to 0 . 5 M CaCl ( 2 ) or normal saline ( NaCl ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O B O O
After 12weeks , animals were euthanized , and CaCl ( 2 ) - treated , CaCl ( 2 ) - untreated ( n = 12 ) and NaCl - treated
O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O B O O
aortic segments ( n = 12 ) were collected for histological and molecular assessments .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
MMP - TIMP and ADAM mRNAs were semi - quantitatively analyzed and protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Despite similar external diameters among CaCl ( 2 ) - treated , non - CaCl ( 2 ) - treated and NaCl - treated segments , aneurymal alteration ( n

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
were demonstrated in CaCl ( 2 ) - treated segments .
O O O B I I I O O O O
MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 , ADAM - 10 and ADAM - 17 mRNA levels were increased in CaCl ( 2 ) - treated segments ( all p

< 0 . 01 ) , with trends of elevation in CaCl ( 2 ) - untreated segments , as compared with NaCl - treated segments .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B O O O O
Immunohistochemistry displayed significantly increased expressions of MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 , ADAM - 10 and ADAM - 17 ( all p < 0 . 01 ) in

intima and media for CaCl ( 2 ) - treated segments .
O O O O B I I I O O O O
TIMP mRNA and tissue levels did not differ obviously among the three aortic segments .

When drugs disappear from the patient : elimination of intravenous medication by hemodiafiltration .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Twenty - three hours after heart transplantation , life - threatening acute right heart failure was diagnosed in a patient requiring continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration ( CVVHDF ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Increasing doses of catecholamines , sedatives , and muscle relaxants administered through a central venous catheter were ineffective .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , a bolus of epinephrine injected through an alternative catheter provoked a hypertensive crisis .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , interference with the central venous infusion by the dialysis catheter was suspected .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The catheters were changed , and hemodynamics stabilized at lower catecholamine doses .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O
When the effects of IV drugs are inadequate in patients receiving CVVHDF , interference with adjacent catheters resulting in elimination of the drug by CVVHDF should be suspected .

Long - term glutamate supplementation failed to protect against peripheral neurotoxicity of paclitaxel .
O O O B O O O O O O O O B O
Toxic peripheral neuropathy is still a significant limiting factor for chemotherapy with paclitaxel ( PAC ) , although glutamate and its closely related amino acid glutamine were claimed to ameliorate
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O B O O O O B I B O O O O
PAC neurotoxicity .
B O O
This pilot trial aimed to evaluate the role of glutamate supplementation for preventing PAC - induced peripheral neuropathy in a randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blinded clinical
O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and electro - diagnostic study .
O O O O O O
Forty - three ovarian cancer patients were available for analysis following six cycles of the same PAC - containing regimen : 23 had been supplemented by glutamate all along the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O
treatment period , at a daily dose of three times 500 mg ( group G ) , and 20 had received a placebo ( group P ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients were evaluated by neurological examinations , questionnaires and sensory - motor nerve conduction studies .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was no significant difference in the frequency of signs or symptoms between the two groups although neurotoxicity symptoms presented mostly with lower scores of severity in group G .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , this difference reached statistical significance only with regard to reported pain sensation ( P = 0 . 011 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also the frequency of abnormal electro - diagnostic findings showed similarity between the two groups ( G : 7 / 23 = 30 . 4 % ; P : 6
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
/ 20 = 30 % ) .
O O O O O O O
This pilot study leads to the conclusion that glutamate supplementation at the chosen regimen fails to protect against peripheral neurotoxicity of PAC .

Attentional modulation of perceived pain intensity in capsaicin - induced secondary hyperalgesia .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Perceived pain intensity is modulated by attention .
O O O O O O O O
However , it is not known that how pain intensity ratings are affected by attention in capsaicin - induced secondary hyperalgesia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Here we show that perceived pain intensity in secondary hyperalgesia is decreased when attention is distracted away from the painful pinprick stimulus with a visual task .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , it was found that the magnitude of attentional modulation in secondary hyperalgesia is very similar to that of capsaicin - untreated , control condition .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Our findings , showing no interaction between capsaicin treatment and attentional modulation suggest that capsaicin - induced secondary hyperalgesia and attention might affect mechanical pain through independent mechanisms .

Testosterone - dependent hypertension and upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen in Dahl salt - sensitive rats .
B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Blood pressure ( BP ) is more salt sensitive in men than in premenopausal women .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
In Dahl salt - sensitive rats ( DS ) , high - salt ( HS ) diet increases BP more in males than females .
O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast to the systemic renin - angiotensin system , which is suppressed in response to HS in male DS , intrarenal angiotensinogen expression is increased , and intrarenal levels
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of ANG II are not suppressed .
O O O O O O O
In this study , the hypothesis was tested that there is a sexual dimorphism in HS - induced upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen mediated by testosterone that also causes increases in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
BP and renal injury .
O O O O O
On a low - salt ( LS ) diet , male DS had higher levels of intrarenal angiotensinogen mRNA than females .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HS diet for 4 wk increased renal cortical angiotensinogen mRNA and protein only in male DS , which was prevented by castration .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ovariectomy of female DS had no effect on intrarenal angiotensinogen expression on either diet .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Radiotelemetric BP was similar between males and castrated rats on LS diet .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HS diet for 4 wk caused a progressive increase in BP , protein and albumin excretion , and glomerular sclerosis in male DS rats , which were attenuated by castration
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Testosterone replacement in castrated DS rats increased BP , renal injury , and upregulation of renal angiotensinogen associated with HS diet .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Testosterone contributes to the development of hypertension and renal injury in male DS rats on HS diet possibly through upregulation of the intrarenal renin - angiotensin system .

Prenatal protein deprivation alters dopamine - mediated behaviors and dopaminergic and glutamatergic receptor binding .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Epidemiological evidence indicates that prenatal nutritional deprivation may increase the risk of schizophrenia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The goal of these studies was to use an animal model to examine the effects of prenatal protein deprivation on behaviors and receptor binding with relevance to schizophrenia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We report that prenatally protein deprived ( PD ) female rats showed an increased stereotypic response to apomorphine and an increased locomotor response to amphetamine in adulthood .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O
These differences were not observed during puberty .
O O O O O O O O
No changes in haloperidol - induced catalepsy or MK - 801 - induced locomotion were seen following PD .
O O O B O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
In addition , PD female rats showed increased ( 3 ) H - MK - 801 binding in the striatum and hippocampus , but not in the cortex .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PD female rats also showed increased ( 3 ) H - haloperidol binding and decreased dopamine transporter binding in striatum .
O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O B O O O O O
No statistically significant changes in behavior or receptor binding were found in PD males with the exception of increased ( 3 ) H - MK - 801 binding in cortex
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O O O
.

This animal model may be useful to explore the mechanisms by which prenatal nutritional deficiency enhances risk for schizophrenia in humans and may also have implications for developmental processes leading

mToR inhibitors - induced proteinuria : mechanisms , significance , and management .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Massive urinary protein excretion has been observed after conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to mammalian target of rapamycin ( mToR ) inhibitors , especially sirolimus , in renal transplant recipients with
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O
chronic allograft nephropathy .
O O O O
Because proteinuria is a major predictive factor of poor transplantation outcome , many studies focused on this adverse event during the past years .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Whether proteinuria was due to sirolimus or only a consequence of calcineurin inhibitors withdrawal remained unsolved until high range proteinuria has been observed during sirolimus therapy in islet transplantation and
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
in patients who received sirolimus de novo .
O O O O B O O O
Podocyte injury and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis have been related to mToR inhibition in some patients , but the pathways underlying these lesions remain hypothetic .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We discuss herein the possible mechanisms and the significance of mToR blockade - induced proteinuria .

Hypothalamic prolactin receptor messenger ribonucleic acid levels , prolactin signaling , and hyperprolactinemic inhibition of pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion are dependent on estradiol .
O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Hyperprolactinemia can reduce fertility and libido .
O O O O O O O
Although central prolactin actions are thought to contribute to this , the mechanisms are poorly understood .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We first tested whether chronic hyperprolactinemia inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility : pulsatile LH secretion and the estrogen - induced LH surge .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Chronic hyperprolactinemia induced by the dopamine antagonist sulpiride caused a 40 % reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats , but only in the presence of chronic low levels of
O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
estradiol .
B O
Sulpiride did not affect the magnitude of a steroid - induced LH surge or the percentage of GnRH neurons activated during the surge .
B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Estradiol is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors ( PRL - R ) and components of prolactin 's signaling pathway .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To test the hypothesis that estrogen increases PRL - R expression and sensitivity to prolactin , we next demonstrated that estradiol greatly augments prolactin - induced STAT5 activation .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Lastly , we measured PRL - R and suppressor of cytokine signaling ( SOCS - 1 and - 3 and CIS , which reflect the level of prolactin signaling )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mRNAs in response to sulpiride and estradiol .
O O O O B O B O
Sulpiride induced only SOCS - 1 in the medial preoptic area , where GnRH neurons are regulated , but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus , PRL - R
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, SOCS - 3 , and CIS mRNA levels were also induced .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Estradiol enhanced these effects on SOCS - 3 and CIS .
B O O O O O O O O O O
Interestingly , estradiol also induced PRL - R , SOCS - 3 , and CIS mRNA levels independently .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These data show that GnRH pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic hyperprolactinemia in a steroid - dependent manner .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
They also provide evidence for estradiol - dependent and brain region - specific regulation of PRL - R expression and signaling responses by prolactin .

Estrogen prevents cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages induced by the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir .
O O B I O O O O O O O O O B O
Individuals with HIV can now live long lives with drug therapy that often includes protease inhibitors such as ritonavir .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Many patients , however , develop negative long - term side effects such as premature atherosclerosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have previously demonstrated that ritonavir treatment increases atherosclerotic lesion formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mice .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , peripheral blood monocytes isolated from ritonavir - treated females had less cholesteryl ester accumulation .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I O O
In the present study , we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in response to the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O
We have utilized the human monocyte cell line ,
O O O O O O O O O
THP - 1 as a model to address this question .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Briefly , cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nM PMA to obtain a macrophage - like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nM
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
17beta - estradiol ( E2 ) , 100 nM progesterone or vehicle ( 0 . 01 % ethanol ) .
B I I O B O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O
Cells were then treated with 30 ng / ml ritonavir or vehicle in the presence of aggregated LDL for 24 h . Cell extracts were harvested , and lipid or
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
total RNA was isolated .
O O O O O
E2 decreased the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages following ritonavir treatment .
B O O O O B I O O O B O O
Ritonavir increased the expression of the scavenger receptor , CD36 mRNA , responsible for the uptake of LDL .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Additionally , ritonavir treatment selectively increased the relative levels of PPARgamma mRNA , a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of CD36 mRNA expression .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Treatment with E2 , however , failed to prevent these increases at the mRNA level .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
E2 did , however , significantly suppress CD36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This data suggests that E2 modifies the expression of CD36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte - derived macrophages resulting in reduced cholesteryl ester accumulation following ritonavir treatment

Upregulation of brain expression of P - glycoprotein in MRP2 - deficient TR ( - ) rats resembles seizure - induced up - regulation of this drug efflux transporter in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
normal rats .
O O O
PURPOSE :
O O
The multidrug resistance protein 2 ( MRP2 ) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
MRP2 is absent in the transport - deficient ( TR ( - ) )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Wistar rat mutant , so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of MRP2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in MRP2 - deficient
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rats with those in transport - competent Wistar rats .
O O O O O O O O O O
By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) , we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for MRP2
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
in the BBB .
O O O O
However , one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This prompted us to study the brain expression of P - glycoprotein ( Pgp ) , a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues , including the BBB , in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
TR ( - ) rats compared with nonmutant ( wild - type ) Wistar rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
The expression of MRP2 and Pgp in brain and liver sections of TR ( - ) rats and normal Wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry , by using a novel
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, highly selective monoclonal MRP2 antibody and the monoclonal Pgp antibody C219 , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Immunofluorescence staining with the MRP2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal Wistar rats , whereas such labeling was absent in TR
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( - ) rats .
O O O O O
TR ( - ) rats exhibited a significant up - regulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild - type controls .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No such obvious upregulation of Pgp was observed in liver sections .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after pilocarpine - induced seizures in wild - type Wistar rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective Pgp inhibitor tariquidar in TR ( - ) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lack of MRP2 in the BBB .
O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
The data on TR ( - ) rats indicate that Pgp plays an important role in the compensation of MRP2 deficiency in the BBB .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds , the present data substantiate the concept that MRP2 performs a protective role
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the BBB .
O O O O
Furthermore , our data suggest that TR ( - ) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the brain , without the need of inducing seizures or other Pgp - enhancing events for this purpose .

Use of chromosome substitution strains to identify seizure susceptibility loci in mice .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Seizure susceptibility varies among inbred mouse strains .
O O O O O O O O
Chromosome substitution strains ( CSS ) , in which a single chromosome from one inbred strain ( donor ) has been transferred onto a second strain ( host ) by
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
repeated backcrossing , may be used to identify quantitative trait loci ( QTLs ) that contribute to seizure susceptibility .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
QTLs for susceptibility to pilocarpine - induced seizures , a model of temporal lobe epilepsy , have not been reported , and CSS have not previously been used to localize
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seizure susceptibility genes .
O O O O
We report QTLs identified using a B6 ( host ) x
O O O O O O O O O O O
A / J ( donor ) CSS panel to localize genes involved in susceptibility to pilocarpine - induced seizures .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Three hundred fifty - five adult male CSS mice , 58 B6 , and 39 A / J were tested for susceptibility to pilocarpine - induced seizures .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Highest stage reached and latency to each stage were recorded for all mice .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
B6 mice were resistant to seizures and slower to reach stages compared to A / J mice .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The CSS for Chromosomes 10 and 18 progressed to the most severe stages , diverging dramatically from the B6 phenotype .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Latencies to stages were also significantly shorter for CSS10 and CSS18 mice .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CSS mapping suggests seizure susceptibility loci on mouse Chromosomes 10 and 18 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This approach provides a framework for identifying potentially novel homologous candidate genes for human temporal lobe epilepsy .

Investigation of mitochondrial involvement in the experimental model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Mitochondrial abnormalities have been associated with several aspects of epileptogenesis , such as energy generation , control of cell death , neurotransmitter synthesis , and free radical ( FR )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
production .
O O
Increased production of FRs may cause mtDNA damage leading to decreased activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes containing mtDNA - encoded subunits .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this study , we investigated whether increased generation of FR during status epilepticus would be sufficient to provoke abnormalities in mtDNA and in the expression and activity of cytochrome
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
c oxidase ( CCO ) , complex IV of the respiratory chain , in the chronic phase of the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
DNA analysis revealed low amounts of a 4 . 8 kb mtDNA deletion but with no differences in frequency or quantity in the control and experimental groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We did not find abnormalities in the expression and distribution of an mtDNA - encoded subunit of CCO ( CCO - I ) or a relative decrease in CCO -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I when compared with nuclear - encoded subunits ( CCO - IV and SDH - fp ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No abnormality in CCO activity was observed through histochemistry .
O O O O O O O O O O
Although evidences of mitochondrial abnormalities were found in previously published studies , our results do not suggest that the FRs , generated during the acute phase , determined important abnormalities
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in mtDNA , in expression of CCO - I , and in CCO activity .

Causes of acute thrombotic microangiopathy in patients receiving kidney transplantation .
O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVES :
O O
Thrombotic microangiopathy is a well - known problem in patients following renal transplantation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In postrenal transplantation , thrombotic microangiopathy is often a reflection of hemolytic uremic syndrome .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We aimed to determine the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy in a population of renal transplantation recipients and discuss the literature .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
MATERIALS AND METHODS :
O O O O
We investigated the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy during a 1 - year period , from June 2003 to June 2004 , at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, Saudi Arabia , by reviewing the slides of all transplant biopsies ( n = 25 ) performed during this interval .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pre - and posttransplant crossmatching was done when possible .
O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Five cases of thrombotic microangiopathy were found .
O O O O O O O O
Three of these cases were from the 25 transplantations performed at King Fahad National Guard Hospital , while the other 2 transplantations had been performed abroad and were referred to
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
us for follow - up .
O O O O O O
Three cases were related to cyclosporine , and 1 case was secondary to both cyclosporine and tacrolimus .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O B O
The fifth case had features of thrombotic microangiopathy related to an antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
In the literature , the most - frequent cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in patients following renal transplantation is recurrence of the hemolytic uremic syndrome .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Other causes include drug - related ( cyclosporine , tacrolimus ) toxicity , procoagulant status , and antibody - mediated rejection .
O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
We found that the most - frequent cause of thrombotic microangiopathy was drug related , secondary mainly to cyclosporine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
In the current study , the frequency of thrombotic microangiopathy was similar to the percentage reported in the literature ( 20 % ) .

Urinary bladder cancer in Wegener 's granulomatosis : risks and relation to cyclophosphamide .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To assess and characterise the risk of bladder cancer , and its relation to cyclophosphamide , in patients with Wegener 's granulomatosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
In the population based , nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register a cohort of 1065 patients with Wegener 's granulomatosis , 1969 - 95 , was identified .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register , all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with bladder cancer were identified .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nested within the cohort , a matched case - control study was performed to estimate the association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer using odds ratios ( ORs ) as relative
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
risk .
O O
In the cohort the cumulative risk of bladder cancer after Wegener 's granulomatosis , and the relative prevalence of a history of bladder cancer at the time of diagnosis of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Wegener 's granulomatosis , were also estimated .
O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The median cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide among cases ( n = 11 ) and controls ( n = 25 ) were 113 g and 25 g , respectively .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The risk of bladder cancer doubled for every 10 g increment in cyclophosphamide ( OR = 2 . 0 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0 . 8
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to 4 . 9 ) .
O O O O O O
Treatment duration longer than 1 year was associated with an eightfold increased risk ( OR = 7 . 7 , 95 % CI 0 . 9 to 69 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The absolute risk for bladder cancer in the cohort reached 10 % 16 years after diagnosis of Wegener 's granulomatosis , and a history of bladder cancer was ( non
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- significantly ) twice as common as expected at the time of diagnosis of Wegener 's granulomatosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
The results indicate a dose - response relationship between cyclophosphamide and the risk of bladder cancer , high cumulative risks in the entire cohort , and also the possibility of
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
risk factors operating even before Wegener 's granulomatosis .

O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B O O
We conclude that cortisol - induced increases in blood pressure are not associated with abnormalities in the l - arginine transport system .

MR imaging with quantitative diffusion mapping of tacrolimus - induced neurotoxicity in organ transplant patients .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Our objective was to investigate brain MR imaging findings and the utility of diffusion - weighted ( DW ) imaging in organ transplant patients who developed neurologic symptoms during
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
tacrolimus therapy .
B O O
Brain MR studies , including DW imaging , were prospectively performed in 14 organ transplant patients receiving tacrolimus who developed neurologic complications .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
In each patient who had abnormalities on the initial MR study , a follow - up MR study was performed 1 month later .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) values on the initial MR study were correlated with reversibility of the lesions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of the 14 patients , 5 ( 35 . 7 % ) had white matter abnormalities , 1 ( 7 . 1 % ) had putaminal hemorrhage , and 8
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( 57 . 1 % ) had normal findings on initial MR images .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Among the 5 patients with white matter abnormalities , 4 patients ( 80 . 0 % ) showed higher than normal ADC values on initial MR images , and all
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
showed complete resolution on follow - up images .
O O O O O O O O O
The remaining 1 patient ( 20 . 0 % ) showed lower than normal ADC value and showed incomplete resolution with cortical laminar necrosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Diffusion - weighted imaging may be useful in predicting the outcomes of the lesions of tacrolimus - induced neurotoxicity .

Sequential observations of exencephaly and subsequent morphological changes by mouse exo utero development system : analysis of the mechanism of transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Anencephaly has been suggested to develop from exencephaly ; however , there is little direct experimental evidence to support this , and the mechanism of transformation remains unclear .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We examined this theory using the exo utero development system that allows direct and sequential observations of mid - to late - gestation mouse embryos .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We observed the exencephaly induced by 5 - azacytidine at embryonic day 13 . 5 ( E13 . 5 ) , let the embryos develop exo utero until E18 .
O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 , and re - observed the same embryos at E18 . 5 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We confirmed several cases of transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly .
O O O O O O O O O O O
However , in many cases , the exencephalic brain tissue was preserved with more or less reduction during this period .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To analyze the transformation patterns , we classified the exencephaly by size and shape of the exencephalic tissue into several types at E13 . 5 and E18 . 5 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was found that the transformation of exencephalic tissue was not simply size - dependent , and all cases of anencephaly at E18 . 5 resulted from embryos with a
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
large amount of exencephalic tissue at E13 . 5 .
O O O O O O O O O O
Microscopic observation showed the configuration of exencephaly at E13 . 5 , frequent hemorrhaging and detachment of the neural plate from surface ectoderm in the exencephalic head at E15 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 , and multiple modes of reduction in the exencephalic tissue at E18 . 5 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
From observations of the vasculature , altered distribution patterns of vessels were identified in the exencephalic head .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings suggest that overgrowth of the exencephalic neural tissue causes the altered distribution patterns of vessels , subsequent peripheral circulatory failure and / or hemorrhaging in various parts of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the exencephalic head , leading to the multiple modes of tissue reduction during transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly .

A range of strain specific sensitivities was documented with A / J and SJL mice being most sensitive and C57BL / 6J most resistant .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DBA / 2J , BALB / cByJ and NZW / LacJ strains exhibited intermediate sensitivity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia complicating FK506 ( tacrolimus ) therapy .
O O O O B O B O O O
We describe 3 episodes of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia ( MAHA ) in 2 solid organ recipients under FK506 ( tacrolimus ) therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O
In both cases , discontinuation of FK506 and treatment with plasma exchange , fresh frozen plasma replacement , corticosteroids , aspirin , and dipyridamole led to resolution of MAHA .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O B O O O O O O
In one patient , reintroduction of FK506 led to rapid recurrence of MAHA .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
FK506 - associated MAHA is probably rare but physicians must be aware of this severe complication .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In our experience and according to the literature , FK506 does not seem to cross - react with cyclosporin A ( CyA ) , an immuno - suppressive drug already

Variant ventricular tachycardia in desipramine toxicity .
O O O O B O O
We report a case of variant ventricular tachycardia induced by desipramine toxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Unusual features of the arrhythmia are repetitive group beating , progressive shortening of the R - R interval , progressive widening of the QRS complex with eventual failure of intraventricular
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
conduction , and changes in direction of the QRS axis .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Recognition of variant ventricular tachycardia is important because therapy differs from that of classic ventricular tachycardia .

Mouse strain - dependent effect of amantadine on motility and brain biogenic amines .
O O O O O O B O O O O O B O
The effect of amantadine hydrochloride , injected i . p .
O O O B I O O O O O O
in 6 increments of 100 mg / kg each over 30 hr , on mouse motility and whole brain content of selected biogenic amines and major metabolites was studied in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
4 strains of mice .
O O O O O
These were the albino Sprague - Dawley ICR and BALB / C , the black C57BL / 6 and the brown CDF - I mouse strains .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Amantadine treatment produced a biphasic effect on mouse motility .
B O O O O O O O O O
The initial dose of amantadine depressed locomotor activity in all mouse strains studied with the BALB / C mice being the most sensitive .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Subsequent amantadine treatments produced enhancement of motility from corresponding control in all mouse strains with the BALB / C mice being the least sensitive .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The locomotor activity was decreased from corresponding controls in all strains studied , except for the ICR mice , during an overnight drug - free period following the fourth
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
amantadine treatment .
B O O
Readministration of amantadine , after a drug - free overnight period , increased motility from respective saline control in all strains with exception of the BALB / C mice where
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
suppression of motility occurred .
O O O O O
Treatment with amantadine did not alter whole brain dopamine levels but decreased the amounts of 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the BALB / C mice compared to saline
O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O
control .
O O
Conversely , brain normetanephrine concentration was increased from saline control by amantadine in the BALB / C mice .
O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The results suggest a strain - dependent effect of amantadine on motility and indicate a differential response to the acute and multiple dose regimens used .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The BALB / C mouse was the most sensitive strain and could serve as the strain of choice for evaluating the side effects of amantadine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The biochemical results of brain biogenic amines of BALB / C mouse strain suggest a probable decrease of catecholamine turnover rate and / or metabolism by monoamine oxidase and a
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
resulting increase in O - methylation of norepinephrine which may account for a behavioral depression caused by amantadine in the BALB / C mice .

No enhancement by phenobarbital of the hepatocarcinogenicity of a choline - devoid diet in the rat .
O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O
An experiment was performed to test whether inclusion of phenobarbital in a choline - devoid diet would increase the hepatocarcinogenicity of the diet .
O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Groups of 5 - week old male Fischer - 344 rats were fed for 7 - 25 months semipurified choline - devoid or choline - supplemented diets , containing or
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O
not 0 . 06 % phenobarbital .
O O O O O B O
No hepatic preneoplastic nodules or hepatocellular carcinomas developed in rats fed the plain choline - supplemented diet , while one preneoplastic nodule and one hepatocellular carcinoma developed in two rats
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
fed the same diet containing phenobarbital .
O O O O O B O
The incidence of preneoplastic nodules and of hepatocellular carcinomas was 10 % and 37 % , respectively , in rats fed the plain choline - devoid diet , and 17
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
% and 30 % , in rats fed the phenobarbital - containing choline - devoid diet .
O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O
The results evinced no enhancement of the hepatocarcinogenicity of the choline - devoid diet by phenobarbital .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O
Sporadic neoplastic lesions were observed in organs other than the liver of some of the animals , irrespective of the diet fed .

Effect of direct intracoronary administration of methylergonovine in patients with and without variant angina .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
The effects of intracoronary administration of methylergonovine were studied in 21 patients with variant angina and 22 patients with atypical chest pain and in others without angina pectoris ( control
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
group ) .
O O O
Methylergonovine was administered continuously at a rate of 10 micrograms / min up to 50 micrograms .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In all patients with variant angina , coronary spasm was provoked at a mean dose of 28 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
13 micrograms ( mean + / -

SD ) .
O O O
In the control group neither ischemic ST change nor localized spasm occurred .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The basal tone of the right coronary artery was significantly lower than that of the left coronary artery .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The percentage of vasoconstriction of the right coronary artery was significantly higher than that of the left coronary artery .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that spasm provocation tests , which use an intracoronary injection of a relatively low dose of methylergonovine , have a high sensitivity in variant angina and the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
vasoreactivity of the right coronary artery may be greater than that of the other coronary arteries .

Effects of aminophylline on the threshold for initiating ventricular fibrillation during respiratory failure .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Cardiac arrhythmias have frequently been reported in association with respiratory failure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The possible additive role of pharmacologic agents in precipitating cardiac disturbances in patients with respiratory failure has only recently been emphasized .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The effects of aminophylline on the ventricular fibrillation threshold during normal acid - base conditions and during respiratory failure were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by passing a gated train of 12 constant current pulses through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
During the infusion of aminophylline , the ventricular fibrillation threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when pH and partial pressures of oxygen ( PO2 )
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) were kept within normal limits .
O B I O B O O O O O O O
When respiratory failure was produced by hypoventilation ( pH 7 . 05 to 7 . 25 ; PC02 70 to 100 mm Hg : P02 20 to 40 mm Hg
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) , infusion of aminophylline resulted in an even greater decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold to 60 percent of the control level .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These experiments suggest that although many factors may contribute to the increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in respiratory failure , pharmacologic agents , particularly aminophylline , may play a significant
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
role .

Case report : acute unintentional carbachol intoxication .
O O O O O B O O
INTRODUCTION :
O O
Intoxications with carbachol , a muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist are rare .
O O B O O O O O O O O O
We report an interesting case investigating a ( near ) fatal poisoning .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
The son of an 84 - year - old male discovered a newspaper report stating clinical success with plant extracts in Alzheimer 's disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mode of action was said to be comparable to that of the synthetic compound ' carbamylcholin ' ; that is , carbachol .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O
He bought 25 g of carbachol as pure substance in a pharmacy , and the father was administered 400 to 500 mg .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Carbachol concentrations in serum and urine on day 1 and 2 of hospital admission were analysed by HPLC - mass spectrometry .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Minutes after oral administration , the patient developed nausea , sweating and hypotension , and finally collapsed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bradycardia , cholinergic symptoms and asystole occurred .
O O O O O O O O
Initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate treatment with adrenaline ( epinephrine ) , atropine and furosemide was successful .
O O O O O O O B O B O O B O B O O O
On hospital admission , blood pressure of the intubated , bradyarrhythmic patient was 100 / 65 mmHg .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Further signs were hyperhidrosis , hypersalivation , bronchorrhoea , and severe miosis ; the electrocardiographic finding was atrio - ventricular dissociation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
High doses of atropine
O O O B
( up to 50 mg per 24 hours ) , adrenaline and dopamine were necessary .
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O
The patient was extubated 1 week later .
O O O O O O O O
However , increased dyspnoea and bronchospasm necessitated reintubation .
O O O O O O O O O
Respiratory insufficiency was further worsened by Proteus mirabilis infection and severe bronchoconstriction .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One week later , the patient was again extubated and 3 days later was transferred to a peripheral ward .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On the next day he died , probably as a result of heart failure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Serum samples from the first and second days contained 3 . 6 and 1 . 9 mg / l carbachol , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
The corresponding urine concentrations amounted to 374 and 554 mg / l .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
This case started with a media report in a popular newspaper , initiated by published , peer - reviewed research on herbals , and involved human failure in a case
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
history , medical examination and clinical treatment .
O O O O O O O O
For the first time , an analytical method for the determination of carbachol in plasma and urine has been developed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
The analysed carbachol concentration exceeded the supposed serum level resulting from a therapeutic dose by a factor of 130 to 260 .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Especially in old patients , intensivists should consider intoxications ( with cholinergics ) as a cause of acute cardiovascular failure .

Crossover comparison of efficacy and preference for rizatriptan 10 mg versus ergotamine / caffeine in migraine .
O O O O O O O B O O O B O B O O O
Rizatriptan is a selective 5 - HT ( 1B / 1D ) receptor agonist with rapid oral absorption and early onset of action in the acute treatment of migraine .
B O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This randomized double - blind crossover outpatient study assessed the preference for 1 rizatriptan 10 mg tablet to 2 ergotamine 1 mg / caffeine 100 mg tablets in 439 patients
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O
treating a single migraine attack with each therapy .
O O O O O O O O O
Of patients expressing a preference ( 89 . 1 % ) , more than twice as many preferred rizatriptan to ergotamine / caffeine ( 69 . 9 vs . 30
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O
. 1 % , p < or = 0 . 001 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Faster relief of headache was the most important reason for preference , cited by 67 . 3 % of patients preferring rizatriptan and 54 . 2 % of patients who
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
preferred ergotamine / caffeine .
O B O B O
The co - primary endpoint of being pain free at 2 h was also in favor of rizatriptan .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Forty - nine percent of patients were pain free 2 h after rizatriptan , compared with 24 . 3 % treated with ergotamine / caffeine ( p < or =
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
0 . 001 ) , rizatriptan being superior within 1 h of treatment .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Headache relief at 2 h was 75 . 9 % for rizatriptan and 47 . 3 % for ergotamine / caffeine ( p < or = 0 . 001 )
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O
, with rizatriptan being superior to ergotamine / caffeine within 30 min of dosing .
O O B O O O B O B O O O O O O
Almost 36 % of patients taking rizatriptan were pain free at 2 h and had no recurrence or need for additional medication within 24 h , compared to 20 %
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of patients on ergotamine / caffeine ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
Rizatriptan was also superior to ergotamine / caffeine in the proportions of patients with no nausea , vomiting , phonophobia or photophobia and for patients with normal function 2 h
B O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after drug intake ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
More patients were ( completely , very or somewhat ) satisfied 2 h after treatment with rizatriptan ( 69 . 8 % ) than at 2 h after treatment with
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ergotamine / caffeine ( 38 . 6 % , p < or = 0 . 001 ) .
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recurrence rates were 31 . 4 % with rizatriptan and 15 . 3 % with ergotamine / caffeine .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O B O
Both active treatments were well tolerated .
O O O O O O O
The most common adverse events ( incidence > or = 5 % in one group ) after rizatriptan and ergotamine / caffeine , respectively , were dizziness ( 6 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O O
7 and 5 . 3 % ) , nausea ( 4 . 2 and 8 . 5 % ) and somnolence ( 5 . 5 and 2 . 3 %

Thrombotic microangiopathy and renal failure associated with antineoplastic chemotherapy .
O O O O O O O O O O
Five patients with carcinoma developed thrombotic microangiopathy ( characterized by renal insufficiency , microangiopathic hemolytic anemia , and usually thrombocytopenia ) after treatment with cisplatin , bleomycin , and a
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O
vinca alkaloid .
B I O
One patient had thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura , three the hemolytic - uremic syndrome , and one an apparent forme fruste of one of these disorders .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Histologic examination of the renal tissue showed evidence of intravascular coagulation , primarily affecting the small arteries , arterioles , and glomeruli .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because each patient was tumor - free or had only a small tumor at the onset of this syndrome , the thrombotic microangiopathy may have been induced by chemotherapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Diagnosis of this potentially fatal complication may be delayed or missed if renal tissue or the peripheral blood smear is not examined , because renal failure may be ascribed to
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cisplatin nephrotoxicity and the anemia and thrombocytopenia to drug - induced bone marrow suppression .

Salvage therapy with nelarabine , etoposide , and cyclophosphamide in relapsed / refractory paediatric T - cell lymphoblastic leukaemia and lymphoma .
O O O B O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A combination of 5 d of nelarabine ( AraG ) with 5 d of etoposide ( VP ) and cyclophosphamide ( CPM ) and prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy was used as
O O O O O O B O B O O O O O B O B O O B O B O O O O O O O O
salvage therapy in seven children with refractory or relapsed T - cell leukaemia or lymphoma .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The most common side effects attributable to the AraG included Grade 2 and 3 sensory and motor neuropathy and musculoskeletal pain .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Haematological toxicity was greater for the combination than AraG alone , although median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was consistent with other salvage therapies .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All patients had some response to the combined therapy and five of the seven went into complete remission after one or two courses of AraG / VP / CPM .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O
Our experience supports the safety of giving AraG as salvage therapy in synchrony with etoposide and cyclophosphamide , although neurological toxicity must be closely monitored .

The 3 - week sulphasalazine syndrome strikes again .
O O O O B O O O O
A 34 - year - old lady developed a constellation of dermatitis , fever , lymphadenopathy and hepatitis , beginning on the 17th day of a course of oral
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sulphasalazine for sero - negative rheumatoid arthritis .
B O O O O O O O
Cervical and inguinal lymph node biopsies showed the features of severe necrotising lymphadenitis , associated with erythrophagocytosis and prominent eosinophilic infiltrates , without viral inclusion bodies , suggestive of an
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
adverse drug reaction .
O O O O
A week later , fulminant drug - induced hepatitis , associated with the presence of anti - nuclear autoantibodies ( but not with other markers of autoimmunity ) , and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
accompanied by multi - organ failure and sepsis , supervened .
O O O O O O O O O O O
She subsequently died some 5 weeks after the commencement of her drug therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Post - mortem examination showed evidence of massive hepatocellular necrosis , acute hypersensitivity myocarditis , focal acute tubulo - interstitial nephritis and extensive bone marrow necrosis , with no evidence
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of malignancy .
O O O
It is thought that the clinico - pathological features and chronology of this case bore the hallmarks of the so - called """" 3 - week sulphasalazine syndrome """" ,

PURPOSE :
O O
We evaluated the safety of indocyanine green for use in fundus angiography .
O O O O O B I O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
We sent a questionnaire concerning complications of indocyanine green to 32 institutions in Japan , which were selected on the basis of the client list from the Topcon Company ,
O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
which manufactures the indocyanine green fundus camera .
O O O B I O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Ophthalmologists at 15 institutions responded , reporting a total of 3 , 774 indocyanine green angiograms performed on 2 , 820 patients between June 1984 and September 1992 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Before angiography , intradermal or intravenous indocyanine green testing , or both was performed at 13 of 15 institutions .
O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
For three patients , the decision was made not to proceed with angiography after positive preangiographic testing .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The dosage of indocyanine green used for angiography varied from 25 to 75 mg , depending upon the institution .
O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There were 13 cases of adverse reactions ( 0 . 34 % ) , ten of which were mild reactions such as nausea , exanthema , urtication , itchiness ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and urgency to defecate , and did not require treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Also recorded were one case of pain of the vein , which required treatment , and two cases of hypotension .

The changes in pain thresholds were determined using mechanical stimuli - - the modification of the classic paw withdrawal test described by Randall - Selitto .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :

NO synthase activity reduces diabetic hyperalgesia .
B O O O O O O
Pretreatment with L - NOArg and L - NIL but not 7 - NI , significantly increases antihyperalgesic activity both HOE 140 and des Arg10 HOE 140 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I I O
It was also shown that both products of inducible NO synthase and neuronal NO synthase activation as well as bradykinin are involved in hyperalgesia produced by vincristine .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O B O
Moreover , L - NOArg and 7 - NI but not L - NIL intensify antihyperalgesic activity of HOE 140 or des - Arg10HOE 140 in toxic neuropathy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I I O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Results of these studies suggest that B1 and B2 receptors are engaged in transmission of nociceptive stimuli in both diabetic and toxic neuropathy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In streptozotocin - induced hyperalgesia , inducible NO synthase participates in pronociceptive activity of bradykinin , whereas in vincristine - induced hyperalgesia bradykinin seemed to activate neuronal NO synthase pathway

Cardiac toxicity observed in association with high - dose cyclophosphamide - based chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
INTRODUCTION :
O O
Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent given frequently as a component of many conditioning regimens .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In high doses , its nonhematological dose - limiting toxicity is cardiomyopathy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
STUDY DESIGN :
O O O
We combined paclitaxel , melphalan and high - dose cyclophosphamide , thiotepa , and carboplatin in a triple sequential high - dose regimen for patients with metastatic breast cancer .
O O B O B O O O O B O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Analysis was performed on 61 women with chemotherapy - responsive metastatic breast cancer receiving 96 - h infusional cyclophosphamide as part of a triple sequential high - dose regimen to
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
assess association between presence of peritransplant congestive heart failure ( CHF ) and the following pretreatment characteristics : presence of electrocardiogram ( EKG ) abnormalities , age , hypertension ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
prior cardiac history , smoking , diabetes mellitus , prior use of anthracyclines , and left - sided chest irradiation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Six of 61 women ( 10 % ) developed clinically reversible grade 3 CHF following infusional cyclophosphamide with a median percent decline in ejection fraction of 31 % .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Incidence of transient cyclophosphamide - related cardiac toxicity ( 10 % ) is comparable to previous recorded literature .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Older age was significantly correlated with the CHF development ; with median ages for the entire group and for patients developing CHF of 45 and 59 , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No association was found with other pretreatment characteristics .
O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
As a result of these findings , oncologists should carefully monitor fluid balance in older patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Routine EKG monitoring during infusional cyclophosphamide did not predict CHF development .

Inappropriate use of carbamazepine and vigabatrin in typical absence seizures .
O O O B O B O O O O O
Carbamazepine and vigabatrin are contraindicated in typical absence seizures .
B O B O O O O O O O
Of 18 consecutive referrals of children with resistant typical absences only , eight were erroneously treated with carbamazepine either as monotherapy or as an add - on .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Vigabatrin was also used in the treatment of two children .
B O O O O O O O O O O
Frequency of absences increased in four children treated with carbamazepine and two of these developed myoclonic jerks , which resolved on withdrawal of carbamazepine .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Absences were aggravated in both cases where vigabatrin was added on to concurrent treatment .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Optimal control of the absences was achieved with sodium valproate , lamotrigine , or ethosuximide alone or in combination .

Hemolytic anemia associated with the use of omeprazole .
O O O O O O O B O
Omeprazole is the first drug designed to block the final step in the acid secretory process within the parietal cell .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It has been shown to be extremely effective in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease , reflux esophagitis , and the Zollinger - Ellison syndrome .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although clinical experience with omeprazole is still limited , many controlled studies have established the short - term safety of this drug .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We report the first case of a serious short - term adverse reaction with the use of omeprazole : hemolytic anemia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The patient developed weakness , lethargy , and shortness of breath 2 days after starting therapy with omeprazole .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Two weeks after the initiation of therapy , her hematocrit had decreased from 44 . 1 % to 20 . 4 % , and she had a positive direct Coombs
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
antiglobulin test and an elevated indirect bilirubin .
O O O O O O B O
After she discontinued the omeprazole , her hemoglobin and hematocrit gradually returned to normal .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
The mechanism by which omeprazole caused the patient 's hemolytic anemia is uncertain , but physicians should be alerted to this possible adverse effect .

Patient response was assessed using changes in CD4 + lymphocyte subset count , HIV p24 antigen , weight , and quality of life .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Seventy patients developed major opportunistic infections whilst on therapy ; this was the first AIDS diagnosis in 17 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Only minor changes in CD4 + lymphocyte subset count were observed in AIDS patients , although a more significant rise occurred in those with earlier stages of disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of those positive for p24 antigen at the commencement of the study 67 % showed a positive response , and this was most likely in those with CD4 + lymphocyte

Can angiogenesis be a target of treatment for ribavirin associated hemolytic anemia ?
O O O O O O O O B O O O O
BACKGROUND / AIMS :
O O O O
Recently ribavirin has been found to inhibit angiogenesis and a number of angiogenesis inhibitors such as sunitinib and sorafenib have been found to cause acute hemolysis .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O
We aimed to investigate whether there is a relation between hemoglobin , haptoglobin and angiogenesis soluble markers which are modifiable and can help in developing strategies against anemia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Fourteen patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus were treated by pegylated interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O
Serum hemoglobin , haptoglobin and angiogenesis markers of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoetin - 2 were investigated before and after therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
We observed a significant decrease in haptoglobin levels at the end of the treatment period .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hemoglobin levels also decreased but insignificantly by treatment .
O O O O O O O O O
In contrast with the literature , serum levels of angiogenesis factors did not change significantly by pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O
We found no correlation of angiogenesis soluble markers with either hemoglobin or haptoglobin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
This is the first study in the literature investigating a link between angiogenesis soluble markers and ribavirin induced anemia in patients with hepatitis C and we could not find any
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
relation .
O O
Future research with larger number of patients is needed to find out modifiable factors that will improve the safety of ribavirin therapy .

Cocaine causes memory and learning impairments in rats : involvement of nuclear factor kappa B and oxidative stress , and prevention by topiramate .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Different mechanisms have been suggested for cocaine toxicity including an increase in oxidative stress but the association between oxidative status in the brain and cocaine induced - behaviour is poorly
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
understood .
O O
Nuclear factor kappa B ( NFkappaB ) is a sensor of oxidative stress and participates in memory formation that could be involved in drug toxicity and addiction mechanisms .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore NFkappaB activity , oxidative stress , neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nNOS ) activity , spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of topiramate , a previously
O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
proposed therapy for cocaine addiction , were evaluated in an experimental model of cocaine administration in rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
NFkappaB activity was decreased in the frontal cortex of cocaine treated rats , as well as GSH concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity in the hippocampus , whereas nNOS activity in
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O
the hippocampus was increased .
O O O O O
Memory retrieval of experiences acquired prior to cocaine administration was impaired and negatively correlated with NFkappaB activity in the frontal cortex .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , learning of new tasks was enhanced and correlated with the increase of nNOS activity and the decrease of glutathione peroxidase .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
These results provide evidence for a possible mechanistic role of oxidative and nitrosative stress and NFkappaB in the alterations induced by cocaine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Topiramate prevented all the alterations observed , showing novel neuroprotective properties .

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for control of intractable cyclophosphamide - induced hemorrhagic cystitis .
O B O O O O O B O O O O O
We report a case of intractable hemorrhagic cystitis due to cyclophosphamide therapy for Wegener 's granulomatosis .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Conservative treatment , including bladder irrigation with physiological saline and instillation of prostaglandin F2 alpha , failed to totally control hemorrhage .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
We then used hyperbaric oxygen at an absolute pressure of 2 atm , 5 days a week for 8 consecutive weeks .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The bleeding ceased completely by the end of treatment and the patient remained free of hematuria thereafter .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No side effect was noted during the course of therapy .

O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
haloperidol as the reference substance .
B O O O O O
The open study lasted for four weeks ; the drug was administrated in the form of 1 mg tablets .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The daily dose ( initial dose : 1 mg ; mean dose at the end of the trial : 4 . 47 mg ) was always administered in one single

Nineteen patients finished the trial , and in 18 cases the therapeutic result was considered very good to good .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results were confirmed by statistical analysis .

Curcumin ameliorates cognitive dysfunction and oxidative damage in phenobarbitone and carbamazepine administered rats .
B O O O O O O O B O B O O O
The antiepileptic drugs , phenobarbitone and carbamazepine are well known to cause cognitive impairment on chronic use .
O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O
The increase in free radical generation has been implicated as one of the important mechanisms of cognitive impairment by antiepileptic drugs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Curcumin has shown antioxidant , anti - inflammatory and neuro - protective properties .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of chronic curcumin administration on phenobarbitone - and carbamazepine - induced cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in rats
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O
.

Pharmacokinetic interactions of curcumin with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine were also studied .
O O O B O B O B O O O O
Vehicle / drugs were administered daily for 21days to male Wistar rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Passive avoidance paradigm and elevated plus maze test were used to assess cognitive function .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At the end of study period , serum phenobarbitone and carbamazepine , whole brain malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione levels were estimated .
O O O O O O O O B O B O O O B O O B O O O O
The administration of phenobarbitone and carbamazepine for 21days caused a significant impairment of learning and memory as well as an increased oxidative stress .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Concomitant curcumin administration prevented the cognitive impairment and decreased the increased oxidative stress induced by these antiepileptic drugs .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Curcumin co - administration did not cause any significant alteration in the serum concentrations of both phenobarbitone as well as carbamazepine .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O
These results show that curcumin has beneficial effect in mitigating the deterioration of cognitive functions and oxidative damage in rats treated with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine without significantly altering their serum

Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate protects the piriform cortex in the pilocarpine status epilepticus model .
B I O O O O O O B O O O O
Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) has a dual mechanism of action as an antioxidant and an inhibitor of the transcription factor kappa - beta .
B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both , production of reactive oxygen species as well as activation of NF - kappaB have been implicated in severe neuronal damage in different sub - regions of the hippocampus
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as well as in the surrounding cortices .
O O O O O O O O
The effect of PDTC on status epilepticus - associated cell loss in the hippocampus and piriform cortex was evaluated in the rat fractionated pilocarpine model .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Treatment with 150 mg / kg PDTC before and following status epilepticus significantly increased the mortality rate to 100 % .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Administration of 50 mg / kg PDTC ( low - dose ) did not exert major effects on the development of a status epilepticus or the mortality rate .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In vehicle - treated rats , status epilepticus caused pronounced neuronal damage in the piriform cortex comprising both pyramidal cells and interneurons .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Low - dose PDTC treatment almost completely protected from lesions in the piriform cortex .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
A significant decrease in neuronal density of the hippocampal hilar formation was identified in vehicle - and PDTC - treated rats following status epilepticus .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
In conclusion , the NF - kappaB inhibitor and antioxidant PDTC protected the piriform cortex , whereas it did not affect hilar neuronal loss .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These data might indicate that the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of NF - kappaB plays a more central role in seizure - associated neuronal damage in the
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
temporal cortex as compared to the hippocampal hilus .
O O O O O O O O O
However , future investigations are necessary to exactly analyze the biochemical mechanisms by which PDTC exerted its beneficial effects in the piriform cortex .

Safety profile of a nicotine lozenge compared with that of nicotine gum in adult smokers with underlying medical conditions : a 12 - week , randomized , open - label
O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
study .
O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Nicotine polacrilex lozenges deliver 25 % to 27 % more nicotine compared with equivalent doses of nicotine polacrilex gum .
B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O
The increased nicotine exposure from the lozenge has raised questions about the relative safety of the lozenge and gum .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to compare the safety profiles of the 4 - mg nicotine lozenge and 4 - mg nicotine gum in smokers with selected
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O
label - restricted diseases .
O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
This was a multicenter , randomized , open - label study in adult smokers with heart disease , hypertension not controlled by medication , and / or diabetes mellitus .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive the 4 - mg nicotine lozenge or 4 - mg nicotine gum .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O
Safety assessments were made at baseline and at 2 , 4 , 6 , and 12 weeks after the start of product use .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Nine hundred one patients were randomized to treatment , 447 who received the lozenge and 454 who received the gum ( safety population ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The majority were women ( 52 . 7 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients ' mean age was 53 . 9 years , their mean weight was 193 . 9 pounds , and they smoked a mean of 25 . 2 cigarettes per
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
day at baseline .
O O O O
Five hundred fifty - three patients , 264 taking the lozenge and 289 taking the gum , used the study product for > or = 4 days per week during
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first 2 weeks ( evaluable population ) .
O O O O O O O O O
The nicotine lozenge and nicotine gum were equally well tolerated , despite increased nicotine exposure from the lozenge .
O B O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
The incidence of adverse events in the 2 groups was similar during the first 2 weeks of product use ( evaluation population : 55 . 3 % lozenge , 54
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
. 7 % gum ) , as well as during the entire study ( safety population : 63 . 8 % and 58 . 6 % , respectively ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Stratification of patients by sex , age , extent of concurrent smoking , extent of product use , and severity of adverse events revealed no clinically significant differences between the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lozenge and gum .
O O O O
The most common adverse events were nausea ( 17 . 2 % and 16 . 1 % ; 95 % CI , - 3 . 7 to 6 . 0
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) , hiccups ( 10 . 7 % and 6 . 6 % ; 95 % CI , 0 . 5 to 7 . 8 ) , and headache (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8 . 7 % and 9 . 9 % ; 95 % Cl , - 5 . 0 to 2 . 6 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Serious adverse events were reported in 11 and 13 patients in the respective groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fewer than 6 % of patients in either group were considered by the investigator to have a worsening of their overall disease condition during the study .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The majority of patients ( > 60 % ) experienced no change in their disease status from baseline .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
The 4 - mg nicotine lozenge and 4 - mg nicotine gum had comparable safety profiles in these patients with label - restricted medical conditions .

Development of levodopa - induced dyskinesias in parkinsonian monkeys may depend upon rate of symptom onset and / or duration of symptoms .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Levodopa - induced dyskinesias ( LIDs ) present a major problem for the long - term management of Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patients .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Due to the interdependence of risk factors in clinical populations , it is difficult to independently examine factors that may influence the development of LIDs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Using macaque monkeys with different types of MPTP - induced parkinsonism , the current study evaluated the degree to which rate of symptom progression , symptom severity , and response
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to and duration of levodopa therapy may be involved in the development of LIDs .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Monkeys with acute ( short - term ) MPTP exposure , rapid symptom onset and short symptom duration prior to initiation of levodopa therapy developed dyskinesia between 11 and 24
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
days of daily levodopa administration .
O O O B O O
In contrast , monkeys with long - term MPTP exposure , slow symptom progression and / or long symptom duration prior to initiation of levodopa therapy were more resistant to
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
developing LIDs ( e . g . , dyskinesia developed no sooner than 146 days of chronic levodopa administration ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
All animals were similarly symptomatic at the start of levodopa treatment and had similar therapeutic responses to the drug .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
These data suggest distinct differences in the propensity to develop LIDs in monkeys with different rates of symptom progression or symptom durations prior to levodopa and demonstrate the value of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
these models for further studying the pathophysiology of LIDs .

Propylthiouracil - induced perinuclear - staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody - positive vasculitis in conjunction with pericarditis .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To describe a case of propylthiouracil - induced vasculitis manifesting with pericarditis .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
We present the first case report of a woman with hyperthyroidism treated with propylthiouracil in whom a syndrome of pericarditis , fever , and glomerulonephritis developed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Serologic testing and immunologic studies were done , and a pericardial biopsy was performed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
A 25 - year - old woman with Graves ' disease had a febrile illness and evidence of pericarditis , which was confirmed by biopsy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Serologic evaluation revealed the presence of perinuclear - staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies ( pANCA ) against myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Propylthiouracil therapy was withdrawn , and she was treated with a 1 - month course of prednisone , which alleviated her symptoms .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
A literature review revealed no prior reports of pericarditis in anti - MPO pANCA - positive vasculitis associated with propylthio - uracil therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Pericarditis may be the initial manifestation of drug - induced vasculitis attributable to propylthio - uracil therapy .

Two mouse lines were selectively bred according to their sensitivity ( BS line ) or resistance ( BR line ) to seizures induced by a single i . p .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
injection of methyl beta - carboline - 3 - carboxylate ( beta - CCM ) , an inverse agonist of the GABA ( A ) receptor benzodiazepine site .
O O B I I I I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O
Our aim was to characterize both lines ' sensitivities to various physiological effects of other ligands of the GABA ( A ) receptor .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
We measured diazepam - induced anxiolysis with the elevated plus - maze test , diazepam - induced sedation by recording the vigilance states , and picrotoxin - and pentylenetetrazol -

injections .
O O
Results presented here show that the differential sensitivities of BS and BR lines to beta - CCM can be extended to diazepam , picrotoxin , and pentylenetetrazol , suggesting a

genetic selection of a general sensitivity and resistance to several ligands of the GABA ( A ) receptor .

Analgesic effect of intravenous ketamine in cancer patients on morphine therapy : a randomized , controlled , double - blind , crossover , double - dose study .
O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pain not responsive to morphine is often problematic .
O O O O B O O O O
Animal and clinical studies have suggested that N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) antagonists , such as ketamine , may be effective in improving opioid analgesia
O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
in difficult pain syndromes , such as neuropathic pain .
O O O O O O O O O O
A slow bolus of subhypnotic doses of ketamine ( 0 . 25 mg / kg or 0 . 50 mg / kg ) was given to 10 cancer patients whose
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pain was unrelieved by morphine in a randomized , double - blind , crossover , double - dose study .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pain intensity on a 0 to 10 numerical scale ; nausea and vomiting , drowsiness , confusion , and dry mouth , using a scale from 0 to 3 (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not at all , slight , a lot , awful ) ; Mini - Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) ( 0 - 30 ) ; and arterial pressure were
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
recorded before administration of drugs ( T0 ) and after 30 minutes ( T30 ) , 60 minutes ( T60 ) , 120 minutes ( T120 ) , and 180
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
minutes ( T180 ) .
O O O O O
Ketamine , but not saline solution , significantly reduced the pain intensity in almost all the patients at both doses .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This effect was more relevant in patients treated with higher doses .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hallucinations occurred in 4 patients , and an unpleasant sensation ( """" empty head """" ) was also reported by 2 patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These episodes reversed after the administration of diazepam 1 mg intravenously .
O O O O O O O B O O O O
Significant increases in drowsiness were reported in patients treated with ketamine in both groups and were more marked with ketamine 0 . 50 mg / kg .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
A significant difference in MMSE was observed at T30 in patients who received 0 . 50 mg / kg of ketamine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Ketamine can improve morphine analgesia in difficult pain syndromes , such as neuropathic pain .
B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
However , the occurrence of central adverse effects should be taken into account , especially when using higher doses .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This observation should be tested in studies of prolonged ketamine administration .

Endocrine screening in 1 , 022 men with erectile dysfunction : clinical significance and cost - effective strategy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PURPOSE :
O O
We reviewed the results of serum testosterone and prolactin determination in 1 , 022 patients referred because of erectile dysfunction and compared the data with history , results of physical
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
examination , other etiological investigations and effects of endocrine therapy to refine the rules of cost - effective endocrine screening and to pinpoint actual responsibility for hormonal abnormalities .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
MATERIALS AND METHODS :
O O O O
Testosterone and prolactin were determined by radioimmunoassay .
B O O O O O O O
Every patient was screened for testosterone and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of low sexual desire , gynecomastia or testosterone
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B
less than 4 ng . / ml .
O O O O O O O O
Determination was repeated in case of abnormal first results .
O O O O O O O O O O
Prolactin results were compared with those of a previous personal cohort of 1 , 340 patients with erectile dysfunction and systematic prolactin determination .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Main clinical criteria tested regarding efficiency in hormone determination were low sexual desire , small testes and gynecomastia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Endocrine therapy consisted of testosterone heptylate or human chorionic gonadotropin for hypogonadism and bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia .
O O O O B I O O O O O O O B O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Testosterone was less than 3 ng . / ml .
B O O O O O O O O O
in 107 patients but normal in 40 % at repeat determination .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The prevalence of repeatedly low testosterone increased with age ( 4 % before age 50 years and 9 % 50 years or older ) .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two pituitary tumors were discovered after testosterone determination .
O O O O O O B O O
Most of the other low testosterone levels seemed to result from nonorganic hypothalamic dysfunction because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
erectile dysfunction ( definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [ 36 % ] after androgen therapy , normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30 % and definite vasculogenic contributions
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in 42 % ) .
O O O O O
Determining testosterone only in cases of low sexual desire or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40 % of the cases with low testosterone , including 37 % of those
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
subsequently improved by androgen therapy .
O O O O O O
Prolactin exceeded 20 ng . / ml .
O O O O O O O O
in 5 men and was normal in 2 at repeat determination .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Only 1 prolactinoma was discovered .
O O O O O O
These data are lower than those we found during the last 2 decades ( overall prolactin greater than 20 ng . / ml .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in 1 . 86 % of 1 , 821 patients , prolactinomas in 7 , 0 . 38 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bromocriptine was definitely effective in cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng . / ml .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( 8 of 12 compared to only 9 of 22 cases with prolactin between 20 and 35 ng . / ml . ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Testosterone was low in less than 50 % of cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng . / ml .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Low prevalences and effects of low testosterone and high prolactin in erectile dysfunction can not justify their routine determination .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , cost - effective screening strategies recommended so far missed 40 to 50 % of cases improved with endocrine therapy and the pituitary tumors .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We now advocate that before age 50 years testosterone be determined only in cases of low sexual desire and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
older than 50 years .
O O O O O
Prolactin should be determined only in cases of low sexual desire , gynecomastia and / or testosterone less than 4 ng . / ml .

Thiopentone pretreatment for propofol injection pain in ambulatory patients .
B O O B O O O O O O
This study investigated propofol injection pain in patients undergoing ambulatory anaesthesia .
O O O B O O O O O O O O
In a randomized , double - blind trial , 90 women were allocated to receive one of three treatments prior to induction of anaesthesia with propofol .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Patients in Group C received 2 ml normal saline , Group L , 2 ml , lidocaine 2 % ( 40 mg ) and Group T , 2 ml
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
thiopentone 2 . 5 % ( 50 mg ) .
B O O O O O O O O O
Venous discomfort was assessed with a visual analogue scale ( VAS ) 5 - 15 sec after commencing propofol administration using an infusion pump ( rate 1000 micrograms . kg
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
- 1 . min - 1 ) .
O O O O O O O O
Loss of consciousness occurred in 60 - 90 sec .
O O O O O O O O O O
Visual analogue scores ( mean + / -
O O O O O O O O
SD ) during induction were lower in Groups L ( 3 . 3 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 . 5 ) and T ( 4 . 1 + / - 2 . 7 ) than in Group C ( 5 . 6 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 . 3 ) ; P = 0 . 0031 .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The incidence of venous discomfort was lower in Group L ( 76 . 6 % ; P < 0 . 05 ) than in Group C ( 100 % )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but not different from Group T ( 90 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The VAS scores for recall of pain in the recovery room were correlated with the VAS scores during induction ( r = 0 . 7045 ; P < 0 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
0001 ) .
O O O
Recovery room discharge times were similar : C ( 75 . 9 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
19 . 4 min ) ; L 73 . 6 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
21 . 6 min ) ; T ( 77 . 1 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
18 . 9 min ) .
O O O O O O
Assessing their overall satisfaction , 89 . 7 % would choose propofol anaesthesia again .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
We conclude that lidocaine reduces the incidence and severity of propofol injection pain in ambulatory patients whereas thiopentone only reduces its severity .

The effectiveness of administration of glycopyrrolate 5 and 10 micrograms kg - 1 and atropine 10 and 20 micrograms kg - 1 i . v .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
immediately before the induction of anaesthesia , to prevent arrhythmia and bradycardia following repeated doses of suxamethonium in children , was studied .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
A control group was included for comparison with the lower dose range of glycopyrrolate and atropine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
A frequency of bradycardia of 50 % was noted in the control group , but this was not significantly different from the frequency with the active drugs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bradycardia ( defined as a decrease in heart rate to less than 50 beat min - 1 ) was prevented when the larger dose of either active drug was used
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
It is recommended that either glycopyrrolate 10 micrograms kg - 1 or atropine 20 micrograms kg - 1 i . v . should immediately precede induction of anaesthesia , in
O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
children , if the repeated administration of suxamethonium is anticipated .

Reduction in caffeine toxicity by acetaminophen .
O O B O O B O
A patient who allegedly consumed 100 tablets of an over - the - counter analgesic containing sodium acetylsalicylate , caffeine , and acetaminophen displayed no significant CNS stimulation despite the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O B O O O O O O O
presence of 175 micrograms of caffeine per mL of serum .
O O O O O B O O O O O
Because salicylates have been reported to augment the stimulatory effects of caffeine on the CNS , attention was focused on the possibility that the presence of acetaminophen ( 52 micrograms
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
/ mL ) reduced the CNS toxicity of caffeine .
O O O O O O O O B O
Studies in DBA / 2J mice showed that : 1 ) pretreatment with acetaminophen ( 100 mg / kg ) increased the interval between the administration of caffeine ( 300
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
to 450 mg / kg IP ) and the onset of fatal convulsions by a factor of about two ; and 2 ) pretreatment with acetaminophen ( 75 mg /
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
kg ) reduced the incidence of audiogenic seizures produced in the presence of caffeine ( 12 . 5 to 75 mg / kg IP ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
The frequency of sound - induced seizures after 12 . 5 or 25 mg / kg caffeine was reduced from 50 to 5 % by acetaminophen .

In the absence of caffeine , acetaminophen ( up to 300 mg / kg ) did not modify the seizures induced by maximal electroshock and did not alter the convulsant

Flestolol : an ultra - short - acting beta - adrenergic blocking agent .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Flestolol ( ACC - 9089 ) is a nonselective , competitive , ultra - short - acting beta - adrenergic blocking agent , without any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity .
B O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Flestolol is metabolized by plasma esterases and has an elimination half - life of approximately 6 . 5 minutes .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This agent was well tolerated in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 micrograms / kg / min .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In long - term infusion studies , flestolol was well tolerated at the effective beta - blocking dose ( 5 micrograms / kg / min ) for up to seven
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
days .
O O
Flestolol blood concentrations increased linearly with increasing dose and good correlation exists between blood concentrations of flestolol and beta - adrenergic blockade .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Flestolol produced a dose - dependent attenuation of isoproterenol - induced tachycardia .
B O O O O O O O B O O O O
Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of flestolol are similar to those of other beta blockers .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
In contrast with other beta blockers , flestolol - induced effects reverse rapidly ( within 30 minutes ) following discontinuation because of its short half - life .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Flestolol effectively reduced heart rate in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia .
B O O O O O O O O O O
In patients with unstable angina , flestolol infusion was found to be safe and effective in controlling chest pain .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is concluded that flestolol is a potent , well - tolerated , ultra - short - acting beta - adrenergic blocking agent .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Use of flestolol in the critical care setting is currently undergoing investigation .

Treatment of tinnitus by intratympanic instillation of lignocaine ( lidocaine ) 2 per cent through ventilation tubes .
O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O
Idiopathic subjective tinnitus ( IST ) is one of the most obscure otological pathologies .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This paper presents the results of treating IST by intratympanic instillation of lignocaine ( lidocaine ) 2 per cent through a grommet , for five weekly courses .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fifty - two patients suffering from intractable tinnitus entered this therapeutic trial , but only nine finished all five courses .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In one patient , the tinnitus was almost completely abolished , but in all the nine patients the decompensated tinnitus changed to a compensated one .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We suggest this mode of treatment for patients that were previously treated by drugs , acupuncture and biofeedback , with disappointing results .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients should be warned about the side effects of vertigo and vomiting , which subsides gradually with every new instillation , and that the tinnitus may not disappear but will
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
be alleviated , enabling them to cope more easily with the disease and lead a more normal life .

Perhexiline maleate and peripheral neuropathy .
B I O O O O
Peripheral neuropathy has been noted as a complication of therapy with perhexiline maleate , a drug widely used in France ( and in clinical trials in the United States )
O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the prophylactic treatment of angina pectoris .
O O O O O O O O
In 24 patients with this complication , the marked slowing of motor nerve conduction velocity and the electromyographic changes imply mainly a demyelinating disorder .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Improvement was noted with cessation of therapy .
O O O O O O O O
In a few cases the presence of active denervation signified a poor prognosis , with only slight improvement .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The underlying mechanism causing the neuropathy is not yet fully known , although some evidence indicates that it may be a lipid storage process .

Effect of humoral modulators of morphine - induced increase in locomotor activity of mice .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
The effect of humoral modulators on the morphine - induced increase in locomotor activity of mice was studied .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
The subcutaneous administration of 10 mg / kg of morphine - HC1 produced a marked increase in locomotor activity in mice .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
The morphine - induced hyperactivity was potentiated by scopolamine and attenuated by physostigmine .
O B O O O O O O B O O O B O
In contrast , both methscopolamine and neostigmine , which do not penetrate the blood - brain barrier , had no effect on the hyperactivity produced by morphine .
O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Pretreatment of mice with alpha - methyltyrosine ( 20 mg / kg

i . p .
O O O O
, one hour ) , an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase , significantly decreased the activity - increasing effects of morphine .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O
On the other hand , pretreatment with p - chlorophenylalamine ( 3 X 320 mg / kg
O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
i . p .
O O O O
, 24 hr ) , a serotonin depletor , caused no significant change in the hyperactivity .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
The study suggests that the activity - increasing effects of morphine are mediated by the release of catecholamines from adrenergic neurons in the brain .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
And the results are consistent with the hypothesis that morphine acts by retarding the release of acetylcholine at some central cholinergic synapses .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O
It is also suggested from collected evidence that the activity - increasing effects of morphine in mice are mediated by mechanisms different from those which mediate the activity - increasing

Mechanisms of FK 506 - induced hypertension in the rat .
O O B I O O O O O O O
- Tacrolimus (
O B O
FK 506 ) is a powerful , widely used immunosuppressant .
B I O O O O O O O O O
The clinical utility of FK 506 is complicated by substantial hypertension and nephrotoxicity .
O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
To clarify the mechanisms of FK 506 - induced hypertension , we studied the chronic effects of FK 506 on the synthesis of endothelin - 1 ( ET - 1
O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
) , the expression of mRNA of ET - 1 and endothelin - converting enzyme - 1 ( ECE - 1 ) , the endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O
) activity , and the expression of mRNA of eNOS and C - type natriuretic peptide ( CNP ) in rat blood vessels .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , the effect of the specific endothelin type A receptor antagonist FR 139317 on FK 506 - induced hypertension in rats was studied .

ET - 1 and the levels of ET - 1 mRNA in the mesenteric artery ( 240 % and 230 % , respectively ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Little change was observed in the expression of ECE - 1 mRNA and CNP mRNA .

The effects of the adjunctive bupropion on male sexual dysfunction induced by a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor : a double - blind placebo - controlled and randomized study .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To determine the safety and efficacy of adjunctive bupropion sustained - release ( SR ) on male sexual dysfunction ( SD ) induced by a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
SSRI ) , as SD is a common side - effect of SSRIs and the most effective treatments have yet to be determined .
B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
PATIENTS AND METHODS :
O O O O
The randomized sample consisted of 234 euthymic men who were receiving some type of SSRI .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The men were randomly assigned to bupropion SR ( 150 mg twice daily , 117 ) or placebo ( twice daily , 117 ) for 12 weeks .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Efficacy was evaluated using the Clinical Global Impression - Sexual Function ( CGI - SF ; the primary outcome measure ) , the International Index of Erectile Function ( IIEF
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) , Arizona Sexual Experience Scale ( ASEX ) , and Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction ( EDITS ) ( secondary outcome measures ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Participants were followed biweekly during study period .
O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
After 12 weeks of treatment , the mean ( sd ) scores for CGI - SF were significantly lower , i . e . better , in patients on
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bupropion SR , at 2 . 4 ( 1 . 2 ) , than in the placebo group , at 3 . 9 ( 1 . 1 ) ( P
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
= 0 . 01 ) .
O O O O O O
Men who received bupropion had a significant increase in the total IIEF score ( 54 . 4 % vs 1 . 2 % ; P = 0 . 003 )
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, and in the five different domains of the IIEF .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Total ASEX scores were significantly lower , i . e . better , among men who received bupropion than placebo , at 15 . 5 ( 4 . 3 )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
vs 21 . 5 ( 4 . 7 ) ( P = 0 . 002 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The EDITS scores were 67 . 4 ( 10 . 2 ) for the bupropion and 36 . 3 ( 11 . 7 ) for the placebo group ( P
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
= 0 . 001 ) .
O O O O O O
The ASEX score and CGI - SF score were correlated ( P = 0 . 003 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In linear regression analyses the CGI - SF score was not affected significantly by the duration of SD , type of SSRI used and age .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Bupropion is an effective treatment for male SD induced by SSRIs .
B O O O O O O O O O B O
These results provide empirical support for conducting a further study of bupropion .

Lamivudine for the prevention of hepatitis B virus reactivation in hepatitis - B surface antigen ( HBSAG )
B O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B O
seropositive cancer patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy .
O O O O O O O
Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) is one of the major causes of chronic liver disease worldwide .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cancer patients who are chronic carriers of HBV have a higher hepatic complication rate while receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy ( CT ) and this has mainly been attributed to HBV reactivation
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
In this study , cancer patients who have solid and hematological malignancies with chronic HBV infection received the antiviral agent lamivudine prior and during CT compared with historical control group
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
who did not receive lamivudine .
O O O O B O
The objectives were to assess the efficacy of lamivudine in reducing the incidence of HBV reactivation , and diminishing morbidity and mortality during CT .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two groups were compared in this study .
O O O O O O O O
The prophylactic lamivudin group consisted of 37 patients who received prophylactic lamivudine treatment .
O O B O O O O O O O O B O O
The historical controls consisted of 50 consecutive patients who underwent CT without prophylactic lamivudine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
They were followed up during and for 8 weeks after CT .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The outcomes were compared for both groups .
O O O O O O O O
Of our control group ( n = 50 ) , 21 patients ( 42 % ) were established hepatitis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Twelve ( 24 % ) of them were evaluated as severe hepatitis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the prophylactic lamivudine group severe hepatitis were observed only in 1 patient ( 2 . 7 % ) of 37 patients ( p < 0 . 006 ) .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Comparison of the mean ALT values revealed significantly higher mean alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) values in the control group than the prophylactic lamivudine group ; 154 : 64 (
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
p < 0 . 32 ) .
O O O O O O O
Our study suggests that prophylactic lamivudine significantly decreases the incidence of HBV reactivation and overall morbidity in cancer patients during and after immunosuppressive therapy .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Further studies are needed to determine the most appropriate nucleoside or nucleotide analogue for antiviral prophylaxis during CT and the optimal duration of administration after completion of CT .

Ginsenoside Rg1 restores the impairment of learning induced by chronic morphine administration in rats .
B I O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Rg1 , as a ginsenoside extracted from Panax ginseng , could ameliorate spatial learning impairment .
B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Previous studies have demonstrated that Rg1 might be a useful agent for the prevention and treatment of the adverse effects of morphine .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Rg1 on learning impairment by chronic morphine administration and the mechanism responsible for this effect .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Male rats were subcutaneously injected with morphine ( 10 mg / kg ) twice a day at 12 hour intervals for 10 days , and Rg1 ( 30 mg /
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
kg ) was intraperitoneally injected 2 hours after the second injection of morphine once a day for 10 days .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Spatial learning capacity was assessed in the Morris water maze .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The results showed that rats treated with Morphine / Rg1 decreased escape latency and increased the time spent in platform quadrant and entering frequency .
O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
By implantation of electrodes and electrophysiological recording in vivo , the results showed that Rg1 restored the long - term potentiation ( LTP ) impaired by morphine in both freely
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
moving and anaesthetised rats .
O O O O O
The electrophysiological recording in vitro showed that Rg1 restored the LTP in slices from the rats treated with morphine , but not changed LTP in the slices from normal saline
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
- or morphine / Rg1 - treated rats ; this restoration could be inhibited by N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist MK801 .
O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O B O O O B O
We conclude that Rg1 may significantly improve the spatial learning capacity impaired by chonic morphine administration and restore the morphine - inhibited LTP .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O
This effect is NMDA receptor dependent .

A study on the effect of the duration of subcutaneous heparin injection on bruising and pain .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
AIM :
O O
This study was carried out to determine the effect of injection duration on bruising and pain following the administration of the subcutaneous injection of heparin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Although different methods to prevent bruising and pain following the subcutaneous injection of heparin have been widely studied and described , the effect of injection duration on the occurrence of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bruising and pain is little documented .
O O O O O O O
DESIGN :
O O
This study was designed as within - subject , quasi - experimental research .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHOD :
O O
The sample for the study consisted of 50 patients to whom subcutaneous heparin was administered .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Heparin was injected over 10 seconds on the right abdominal site and 30 seconds on the left abdominal site .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Injections areas were assessed for the presence of bruising at 48 and 72 hours after each injection .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Dimensions of the bruising on the heparin applied areas were measured using transparent millimetric measuring paper .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
The visual analog scale ( VAS ) was used to measure pain intensity and a stop - watch was used to time the pain period .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Data were analysed using chi - square test , Mann - Whitney U , Wilcoxon signed ranks tests and correlation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The percentage of bruising occurrence was 64 % with the injection of 10 seconds duration and 42 % in the 30 - second injection .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was determined that the size of the bruising was smaller in the 30 - second injection .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pain intensity and pain period were statistically significantly lower for the 30 - second injection than for the 10 - second injection .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
It was determined that injection duration had an effect on bruising and pain following the subcutaneous administration of heparin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
This study should be repeated on a larger sample .

Acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol treatments change synaptosomal brain glutamate uptake and elicit orofacial dyskinesia in rats .
O B O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Reserpine - and haloperidol - induced orofacial dyskinesia are putative animal models of tardive dyskinesia ( TD ) whose pathophysiology has been related to free radical generation and oxidative stress
B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
In the present study , the authors induced orofacial dyskinesia by acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol administration to rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O
Reserpine injection ( one dose of 1 mg / kg s . c . )
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
every other day for 3 days caused a significant increase in vacuous chewing , tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching , compared to the control .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Haloperidol administration ( one dose of 12 mg / kg once a week s . c . ) for 4 weeks caused an increase in vacuous chewing , tongue protrusion
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and duration of facial twitching observed in four weekly evaluations .
O O O O O O O O O O O
After the treatments and behavioral observation , glutamate uptake by segments of the brain was analyzed .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
A decreased glutamate uptake was observed in the subcortical parts of animals treated with reserpine and haloperidol , compared to the control .

Acute psychosis due to treatment with phenytoin in a nonepileptic patient .
O O O O O O B O O O O O
The development of psychosis related to antiepileptic drug treatment is usually attributed to the interaction between the epileptic brain substratum and the antiepileptic drugs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The case of a nonepileptic patient who developed psychosis following phenytoin treatment for trigeminal neuralgia is described .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
This case suggests that the psychotic symptoms that occur following phenytoin treatment in some epileptic patients may be the direct result of medication , unrelated to seizures .

The effect of treatment with gum Arabic on gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats : a preliminary study .
O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O
In the present work we assessed the effect of treatment of rats with gum Arabic on acute renal failure induced by gentamicin ( GM ) nephrotoxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O B O B O O O
Rats were treated with the vehicle ( 2 mL / kg of distilled water and 5 % w / v cellulose , 10 days ) , gum Arabic ( 2
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O
mL / kg of a 10 % w / v aqueous suspension of gum Arabic powder , orally for 10 days ) , or gum Arabic concomitantly with GM (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O B I O O B O
80mg / kg / day intramuscularly , during the last six days of the treatment period ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nephrotoxicity was assessed by measuring the concentrations of creatinine and urea in the plasma and reduced glutathione ( GSH ) in the kidney cortex , and by light microscopic examination
O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O
of kidney sections .
O O O O
The results indicated that concomitant treatment with gum Arabic and GM significantly increased creatinine and urea by about 183 and 239 % , respectively ( compared to 432 and 346
O O O O O O O B I O B O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
% , respectively , in rats treated with cellulose and GM ) , and decreased that of cortical GSH by 21 % ( compared to 27 % in the cellulose
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
plus GM group )
O B O O
The GM - induced proximal tubular necrosis appeared to be slightly less severe in rats given GM together with gum Arabic than in those given GM and cellulose .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I O O O O B O O O
It could be inferred that gum Arabic treatment has induced a modest amelioration of some of the histological and biochemical indices of GM nephrotoxicity .

Visual hallucinations associated with zonisamide .
O O O O B O
Zonisamide is a broad - spectrum antiepileptic drug used to treat various types of seizures .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although visual hallucinations have not been reported as an adverse effect of this agent , we describe three patients who experienced complex visual hallucinations and altered mental status after
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
zonisamide treatment was begun or its dosage increased .
B O O O O O O O O
All three had been diagnosed earlier with epilepsy , and their electroencephalogram ( EEG ) findings were abnormal .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
During monitoring , visual hallucinations did not correlate with EEG readings , nor did video recording capture any of the described events .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
None of the patients had experienced visual hallucinations before this event .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The only recent change in their treatment was the introduction or increased dosage of zonisamide .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
With either discontinuation or decreased dosage of the drug the symptoms disappeared and did not recur .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Further observations and reports will help clarify this adverse effect .

GLEPP1 receptor tyrosine phosphatase ( Ptpro ) in rat PAN nephrosis .
O O B O O O O O O B O O
A marker of acute podocyte injury .
O O O O O O O
Glomerular epithelial protein 1 ( GLEPP1 ) is a podocyte receptor membrane protein tyrosine phosphatase located on the apical cell membrane of visceral glomerular epithelial cell and foot processes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This receptor plays a role in regulating the structure and function of podocyte foot process .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To better understand the utility of GLEPP1 as a marker of glomerular injury , the amount and distribution of GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were examined by immunohistochemistry , Western blot
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and RNase protection assay in a model of podocyte injury in the rat .

Puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN , 20 mg / 100 g BW ) .
B I O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O
Tissues were analyzed at 0 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 21 , 45 , 80 and 126 days after PAN injection so as to include both the acute
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
phase of proteinuria associated with foot process effacement ( days 5 - 11 ) and the chronic phase of proteinuria associated with glomerulosclerosis ( days 45 - 126 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At day 5 , GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were reduced from the normal range ( 265 . 2 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
79 . 6 x 10 ( 6 ) moles / glomerulus and 100 % ) to 15 % of normal ( 41 . 8 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 . 8 x 10 ( 6 ) moles / glomerulus , p < 0 . 005 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This occurred in association with an increase in urinary protein content from 1 . 8 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 to 99 . 0 + / -
O O O O O O O O
61 mg / day ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , podocalyxin did not change significantly at this time .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
By day 11 , GLEPP1 protein and mRNA had begun to return towards baseline .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
By day 45 - 126 , at a time when glomerular scarring was present , GLEPP1 was absent from glomerulosclerotic areas although the total glomerular content of GLEPP1 was not
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
different from normal .
O O O O
We conclude that GLEPP1 expression , unlike podocalyxin , reflects podocyte injury induced by PAN .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
GLEPP1 expression may be a useful marker of podocyte injury .

Ticlopidine - induced aplastic anemia : report of three Chinese patients and review of the literature .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this study , three Chinese patients with ticlopidine - induced aplastic anemia were reported and another 13 patients in the English literature were reviewed .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We attempted to find underlying similarities , evaluate the risk factors , and identify appropriate treatment for this complication .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All but one of the patients were over 60 years old , and the 6 who died were all older than 65 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , old age may be a risk factor for developing this complication .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Agranulocytosis occurred 3 - 20 weeks after initiation of ticlopidine , so frequent examination of white cell count during treatment is recommended .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There seemed to be no direct correlation between the dose or duration used and the severity of bone marrow suppression .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Treatment for ticlopidine - induced aplastic anemia with colony - stimulating factors seemed to have little effect .

The fact that 5 of the 6 patients who received concurrent calcium channel blockers died , should alert clinicians to be more cautious when using these two drugs simultaneously .

Facilitation of memory retrieval by pre - test morphine and its state dependency in the step - through type passive avoidance learning test in mice .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Amnesia produced by scopolamine and cycloheximide were reversed by morphine given 30 min before the test trial ( pre - test ) , and pre - test morphine also facilitated
O O O B O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
the memory retrieval in the animals administered naloxone during the training trial .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Similarly , pre - test scopolamine partially reversed the scopolamine - induced amnesia , but not significantly ; and pre - test cycloheximide failed to reverse the cycloheximide - induced
O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O
amnesia .

These results suggest that the facilitation of memory retrieval by pre - test morphine might be the direct action of morphine rather than a state dependent effect .

Test conditions influence the response to a drug challenge in rodents .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
These studies were conducted to examine the differential response to a drug challenge under varied experimental test conditions routinely employed to study drug - induced behavioral and neurophysiological responses in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rodents .
O O
Apomorphine , a nonselective dopamine agonist , was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects , its ability to induce hypothermia , and to produce distinct changes to dopamine turnover
B O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
in the rodent brain .
O O O O O
From such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of apomorphine - induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employed .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In rats , detection of apomorphine - induced hyperactivity was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Moreover , test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to apomorphine such as drug - induced hypothermia .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
In mice , apomorphine produced qualitatively different responses under novel conditions when compared to those behaviors elicited in the home test cage .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Drug - induced gross activity counts were increased in the novel exploratory box only , while measures of stereotypic behavior were similar in both .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
By contrast , apomorphine - induced locomotion was more prominent in the novel exploratory box .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Dopamine turnover ratios ( DOPAC : DA and HVA : DA ) were found to be lower in those animals exposed to the exploratory box when compared to their home
B O O O B O B O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cage counterparts .
O O O
However , apomorphine - induced reductions in striatal dopamine turnover were detected in both novel and home cage environments .

The implications of these findings are discussed with particular emphasis upon conducting psychopharmacological challenge tests in rodents .

Sixty - three percent of these infants had tricuspid valve involvement .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lithium carbonate may be a factor in the increasing incidence of congenital heart disease when taken during early pregnancy .

Acute changes of blood ammonia may predict short - term adverse effects of valproic acid .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I O
Valproic acid ( VPA ) was given to 24 epileptic patients who were already being treated with other antiepileptic drugs .
B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A standardized loading dose of VPA was administered , and venous blood was sampled at 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 hours .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ammonia ( NH3 ) was higher in patients who , during continuous therapy , complained of drowsiness ( 7 patients ) than in those who were symptom - free (

17 patients ) , although VPA plasma levels were similar in both groups .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
By measuring VPA - induced changes of blood NH3 content , it may be possible to identify patients at higher risk of obtundation when VPA is given chronically .

injection of human and salmon calcitonin on biochemical and behavioral parameters related to the extrapyramidal motor system , were investigated in male rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Calcitonin injection resulted in a potentiation of haloperidol - induced catalepsy and a partial prevention of apomorphine - induced hyperactivity .

A time course was established for the change in tissue mass , RNA and DNA content , as well as hydroxyproline content .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Heart weight increased 44 % after 8 days of treatment with a half time of 3 . 4 days .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ventricular RNA content was elevated 26 % after 24 h of a single injection and reached a maximal level following 8 days of therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The half time for RNA accumulation was 2 . 0 days .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The total content of hydroxyproline remained stable during the first 2 days of treatment but increased 46 % after 4 days of therapy .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ventricular DNA content was unchanged during the early stage ( 1 - 4 days ) of hypertrophic growth but increased to a new steady - state level 19 % above
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the controls after 8 days of treatment .
O O O O O O O O
Intraventricular pressures and coronary flow measures were similar for control and experimental animals following 4 days of developed hypertrophy .

However , dP / dt in the ISO - treated hearts was slightly but significantly
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
( P less than 0 . 05 ) elevated .

The potential modifying effect of retinyl acetate ( RA ) on butylated hydroxyanisole ( BHA ) - induced rat forestomach tumorigenesis was examined .
O O O O O B I O B O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O
Male F344 rats , 5 weeks of age , were maintained on diet containing 1 % or 2 % BHA by weight and simultaneously on drinking water supplemented with
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
RA at various concentrations ( w / v ) for 52 weeks .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O
In groups given 2 % BHA , although marked hyperplastic changes of the forestomach epithelium were observed in all animals , co - administration of 0 . 25 %
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RA significantly ( P less than 0 . 05 ) increased the incidence of forestomach tumors ( squamous cell papilloma and carcinoma ) to 60 % ( 9 / 15
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
In rats given 1 % BHA , RA co - administered at a dose of 0 . 05 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 2 or 0 . 25
O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Ketanserin pretreatment reverses alfentanil - induced muscle rigidity .
B O O B O O O O O
Systemic pretreatment with ketanserin , a relatively specific type - 2 serotonin receptor antagonist , significantly attenuated the muscle rigidity produced in rats by the potent short - acting opiate

agonist alfentanil .

Following placement of subcutaneous electrodes in each animal 's left gastrocnemius muscle , rigidity was assessed by analyzing root - mean - square electromyographic activity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Intraperitoneal ketanserin administration at doses of 0 . 63 and 2 . 5 mg / kg prevented the alfentanil - induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
saline .
O O
Chlordiazepoxide at doses up to 10 mg / kg failed to significantly influence the rigidity produced by alfentanil .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Despite the absence of rigidity , animals that received ketanserin ( greater than 0 . 31 mg / kg i . p . ) followed by alfentanil were motionless ,
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
flaccid , and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving alfentanil alone .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Rats that received ketanserin and alfentanil exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60 - min recording period than did animals that received ketanserin alone .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
These results , in combination with previous work , suggest that muscle rigidity , a clinically relevant side - effect of parenteral narcotic administration , may be partly mediated via
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
serotonergic pathways .

min - 1 ) .
O O O O O
Use of glycopyrronium 5 micrograms

Involvement of locus coeruleus and noradrenergic neurotransmission in fentanyl - induced muscular rigidity in the rat .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Whereas muscular rigidity is a well - known side effect that is associated with high - dose fentanyl anesthesia , a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
mechanism ( s ) .
O O O O O
We investigated in this study the possible engagement of locus coeruleus of the pons in this phenomenon , using male Sprague - Dawley rats anesthetized with ketamine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Under proper control of respiration , body temperature and end - tidal CO2 , intravenous administration of fentanyl ( 50 or 100 micrograms / kg ) consistently promoted an increase
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
in electromyographic activity recorded from the gastrocnemius and abdominal rectus muscles .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Such an induced muscular rigidity by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha - adrenoceptor
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
blocker , prazosin .
O O B O
Microinjection of fentanyl ( 2 . 5 micrograms / 50 nl ) directly into this pontine nucleus , on the other hand , elicited discernible electromyographic excitation .

It is speculated that the induction of muscular rigidity by fentanyl may involve the coerulospinal noradrenergic fibers to the spinal motoneurons .

As standard practice at our institution , patients who are scheduled to receive a bone marrow transplant are treated prophylactically with forced hydration and bladder irrigation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In an attempt to obviate the inconvenience of bladder irrigation , we conducted a feasibility trial of uroprophylaxis with mesna , which neutralizes the hepatic metabolite of cyclophosphamide that causes
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O
hemorrhagic cystitis .
O O O
Of 97 patients who received standard prophylaxis , 4 had symptomatic hemorrhagic cystitis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , two of four consecutive patients who received mesna uroprophylaxis before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation had severe hemorrhagic cystitis for at least 2 weeks .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because of this suboptimal result , we resumed the use of bladder irrigation and forced hydration to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis .

The Flumazenil in Intravenous Conscious Sedation with Diazepam Multicenter Study Group II .
O B O O O O O B O O O O O
The efficacy and safety of a new benzodiazepine antagonist , flumazenil , were assessed in a double - blind multicenter study .
O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Flumazenil ( mean dose , 0 . 76 mg ) or placebo ( mean dose , 8 . 9 ml ) was administered intravenously to 130 and 67 patients ,
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
respectively , who had been given diazepam in conjunction with an opioid ( fentanyl , meperidine , or morphine ) for the induction and maintenance of intravenous conscious sedation for
O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
diagnostic or therapeutic surgical procedures .
O O O O O O
The group assessable for efficacy comprised 122 patients treated with flumazenil and 64 patients given placebo .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
After 5 minutes , 80 / 115 ( 70 % ) flumazenil - treated patients , compared with 21 / 63 ( 33 % ) placebo - treated patients ,
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
were completely awake and alert , as indicated by a score of 5 on the Observer 's Assessment of Alertness / Sedation Scale .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ninety - five percent of patients in each group who attained a score of 5 at the 5 - minute assessment showed no loss of alertness throughout the 180 -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
minute assessment period .
O O O O
Flumazenil - treated patients also performed significantly better on the Finger - to - Nose Test and the recall of pictures shown at the 5 - minute assessment .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Flumazenil was well tolerated , with no serious adverse effects reported .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
Thirty - nine ( 30 % ) of flumazenil - treated patients , compared with 17 ( 25 % ) of placebo - treated patients had one or more drug
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Arterial thromboembolism in patients receiving systemic heparin therapy : a complication associated with heparin - induced thrombocytopenia .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O
Arterial thromboembolism is a recognized complication of systemic heparin therapy .
O O O O O O O O B O O
Characteristic of the entity is arterial occlusion by platelet - fibrin thrombi with distal ischemia occurring four to twenty days after the initiation of heparin therapy , preceded by profound
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
thrombocytopenia with platelet counts in the range of 30 , 000 to 40 , 000 per cubic millimeter .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The clinically apparent occlusion may be preceded by gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms that appear to be ischemic in origin , and might serve to warn the clinician of these complications
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Previous reports of these phenomena as well as recent studies of the effect of heparin are reviewed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
The common factor relating thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia is heparin - induced platelet aggregation .

Long - term prognosis for transplant - free survivors of paracetamol - induced acute liver failure .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
The prognosis for transplant - free survivors of paracetamol - induced acute liver failure remains unknown .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
AIM :
O O
To examine whether paracetamol - induced acute liver failure increases long - term mortality .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
We followed up all transplant - free survivors of paracetamol - induced acute liver injury , hospitalized in a Danish national referral centre during 1984 - 2004 .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We compared age - specific mortality rates from 1 year post - discharge through 2008 between those in whom the liver injury led to an acute liver failure and those
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in whom it did not .
O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
We included 641 patients .
O O O O O
On average , age - specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose paracetamol - induced liver injury had caused an acute liver failure ( adjusted mortality
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rate ratio = 1 . 70 , 95 % CI 1 . 02 - 2 . 85 ) , but the association was age - dependent , and no survivors
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of acute liver failure died of liver disease , whereas suicides were frequent in both groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These observations speak against long - term effects of acute liver failure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
More likely , the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of substance abuse among survivors of acute liver failure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Paracetamol - induced acute liver failure did not affect long - term mortality .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical follow - up may be justified by the cause of the liver failure , but not by the liver failure itself .

Serotonin 6 receptor gene is associated with methamphetamine - induced psychosis in a Japanese population .
B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Altered serotonergic neural transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The serotonin 6 ( 5 - HT6 ) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics , such as clozapine and olanzapine , and d - amphetamine - induced
O B O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O B I I O O
hyperactivity in rats is corrected with the use of a selective 5 - HT6 receptor antagonist .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
In addition , the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by d - amphetamine or phencyclidine was restored by 5 - HT6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats .
O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia , and the above evidence suggests that altered 5 - HT6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
psychotic disorders .
O O O
The symptoms of methamphetamine ( METH ) - induced psychosis are similar to those of paranoid type schizophrenia .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5 - HT6 gene ( HTR6 ) with METH - induced psychosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O B O O O O
METHOD :
O O
Using five tagging SNPs ( rs6693503 , rs1805054 , rs4912138 , rs3790757 and rs9659997 ) , we conducted a genetic association analysis of case - control samples ( 197
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METH - induced psychosis patients and 337 controls ) in the Japanese population .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The age and sex of the control subjects did not differ from those of the methamphetamine dependence patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
RESULTS :
O O
rs6693503 was associated with METH - induced psychosis patients in the allele / genotype - wise analysis .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Moreover , this association remained significant after Bonferroni correction .
O O O O O O O O O O
In the haplotype - wise analysis , we detected an association between two markers ( rs6693503 and rs1805054 ) and three markers ( rs6693503 , rs1805054 and rs4912138 ) in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HTR6 and METH - induced psychosis patients , respectively .
O O B O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
HTR6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of METH - induced psychosis in the Japanese population .

Effect of increasing intraperitoneal infusion rates on bupropion hydrochloride - induced seizures in mice .
O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
BACKGROUND : It is not known if there is a relationship between input rate and incidence of bupropion - induced seizures .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
This is important , since different controlled release formulations of bupropion release the active drug at different rates .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
We investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of bupropion HCl 120 mg / kg , a known convulsive dose 50 ( CD50 ) , on the incidence
O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and severity of bupropion - induced convulsions in the Swiss albino mice .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O
A total of 69 mice , approximately 7 weeks of age , and weighing 21 . 0 to 29 . 1 g were randomly assigned to bupropion HCl 120 mg
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O
/ kg treatment by intraperitoneal ( IP ) administration in 7 groups ( 9 to 10 animals per group ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bupropion HCl was infused through a surgically implanted IP dosing catheter with infusions in each group of 0 min , 15 min , 30 min , 60 min , 90
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
min , 120 min , and 240 min .
O O O O O O O O O
The number , time of onset , duration and the intensity of the convulsions or absence of convulsions were recorded .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The results showed that IP administration of bupropion HCl 120 mg / kg by bolus injection induced convulsions in 6 out of 10 mice ( 60 % of convulsing mice
O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) in group 1 .
O O O O O
Logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant ( p = 0 . 0004 ; odds ratio = 0 . 974 ) and increasing the IP infusion time of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bupropion HCl 120 mg / kg was associated with a 91 % reduced odds of convulsions at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Further increase in infusion time resulted in further reduction in the odds of convulsions to 99 . 8 % reduction at 240 min .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
In conclusion , the demonstration of an inverse relationship between infusion time of a fixed and convulsive dose of bupropion and the risk of convulsions in a prospective study is

Detailed spectral profile analysis of penicillin - induced epileptiform activity in anesthetized rats .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Penicillin model is a widely used experimental model for epilepsy research .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
In the present study we aimed to portray a detailed spectral analysis of penicillin - induced epileptiform activity in comparison with basal brain activity in anesthetized Wistar rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with i . p .
O O O O O O O O O O
urethane and connected to an electrocorticogram setup .
B O O O O O O O
After a short period of basal activity recording , epileptic focus was induced by injecting 400IU / 2 microl penicillin - G potassium into the left lateral ventricle while the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O
cortical activity was continuously recorded .
O O O O O O
Basal activity , latent period and the penicillin - induced epileptiform activity periods were then analyzed using both conventional methods and spectral analysis .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Spectral analyses were conducted by dividing the whole spectrum into different frequency bands including delta , theta ( slow and fast ) , alpha - sigma , beta ( 1
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and 2 ) and gamma ( 1 and 2 ) bands .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our results show that the most affected frequency bands were delta , theta , beta - 2 and gamma - 2 bands during the epileptiform activity and there were marked
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
differences in terms of spectral densities between three investigated episodes ( basal activity , latent period and epileptiform activity ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our results may help to analyze novel data obtained using similar experimental models and the simple analysis method described here can be used in similar studies to investigate the basic

This large - scale retrospective review evaluates the sedation profile of dexmedetomidine .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O
AIM :

To determine the hemodynamic responses , efficacy and adverse events associated with the use of high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative for magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) studies
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Dexmedetomidine has been used at our institution since 2005 to provide sedation for pediatric radiological imaging studies .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Over time , an effective protocol utilizing high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative agent has evolved .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
METHODS / MATERIALS :
O O O O
As part of the ongoing Quality Assurance process , data on all sedations are reviewed monthly and protocols modified as needed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Data were analyzed from all 747 consecutive patients who received dexmedetomidine for MRI sedation from April 2005 to April 2007 .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Since 2005 , the 10 - min loading dose of our dexmedetomidine protocol increased from 2 to 3 microg . kg ( - 1 ) , and the infusion rate
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
increased from 1 to 1 . 5 to 2 microg . kg ( - 1 ) . h ( - 1 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The current sedation protocol progressively increased the rate of successful sedation ( able to complete the imaging study ) when using dexmedetomidine alone from 91 . 8 % to 97
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
. 6 % ( P = 0 . 009 ) , reducing the requirement for adjuvant pentobarbital in the event of sedation failure with dexmedetomidine alone and decreased the mean
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O
recovery time by 10 min ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although dexmedetomidine sedation was associated with a 16 % incidence of bradycardia , all concomitant mean arterial blood pressures were within 20 % of age - adjusted normal range and
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oxygen saturations were 95 % or higher .
B O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Dexmedetomidine in high doses provides adequate sedation for pediatric MRI studies .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
While use of high dose dexmedetomidine is associated with decreases in heart rate and blood pressure outside the established ' awake ' norms , this deviation is generally within 20
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
% of norms , and is not associated with adverse sequelae .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Dexmedetomidine is useful as the sole sedative for pediatric MRI .

Methamphetamine causes alterations in the MAP kinase - related pathways in the brains of mice that display increased aggressiveness .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Aggressive behaviors have been reported in patients who suffer from some psychiatric disorders , and are common in methamphetamine ( METH ) abusers .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O
Herein , we report that multiple ( but not single ) injections of METH significantly increased aggressiveness in male CD - 1 mice .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
This increase in aggressiveness was not secondary to METH - induced hyperactivity .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Analysis of protein expression using antibody microarrays and Western blotting revealed differential changes in MAP kinase - related pathways after multiple and single METH injections .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
There were statistically significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) decreases in MEK1 , Erk2p , GSK3alpha , 14 - 3 - 3e , and MEK7 in the striata
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of mice after multiple injections of METH .
O O O O O O B O
MEK1 was significantly decreased also after a single injection of METH , but to a much lesser degree than after multiple injections of METH .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
In the frontal cortex , there was a statistically significant decrease in GSK3alpha after multiple ( but not single ) injections of METH .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
These findings suggest that alterations in MAP kinase - related pathways in the prefronto - striatal circuitries might be involved in the manifestation of aggressive behaviors in mice .

Lamotrigine associated with exacerbation or de novo myoclonus in idiopathic generalized epilepsies .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Five patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsies ( IGE ) treated with lamotrigine ( LTG ) experienced exacerbation or de novo appearance of myoclonic jerks ( MJ ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In three patients , LTG exacerbated MJ in a dose - dependent manner with early aggravation during titration .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
MJ disappeared when LTG dose was decreased by 25 to 50 % .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O
In two patients , LTG exacerbated MJ in a delayed but more severe manner , with myoclonic status that only ceased after LTG withdrawal .

rTMS of supplementary motor area modulates therapy - induced dyskinesias in Parkinson disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The neural mechanisms and circuitry involved in levodopa - induced dyskinesia are unclear .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) over the supplementary motor area ( SMA ) in a group of patients with advanced Parkinson disease , the authors investigated whether
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
modulation of SMA excitability may result in a modification of a dyskinetic state induced by continuous apomorphine infusion .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
rTMS at 1 Hz was observed to markedly reduce drug - induced dyskinesias , whereas 5 - Hz rTMS induced a slight but not significant increase .

Assessment of the onset and persistence of amnesia during procedural sedation with propofol .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
OBJECTIVES :
O O
To assess patients ' ability to repeat and recall words presented to them while undergoing procedural sedation with propofol , and correlate their recall with their level of awareness as
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
measured by bispectral index ( BIS ) monitoring .
O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
This was a prospective , single - intervention study of consenting adult patients undergoing procedural sedation with propofol between December 28 , 2002 , and October 31 , 2003 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
BIS monitoring was initiated starting 3 minutes before the procedure and continuing until the patient had regained baseline mental status .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At 1 - minute intervals during the procedural sedation , until the patient regained baseline mental status at the end of the procedure , a word from a standardized list
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was read aloud , and the patient was asked to immediately repeat the word to the investigator .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The BIS score at the time the word was read and the patient 's ability to repeat the word were recorded .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After the procedure , the patient was asked to state all of the words from the list that he or she could recall , and to identify the last word
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
recalled from prior to the start of the procedure and the first word recalled from after the procedure was completed .

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
were recalled when the corresponding BIS score was less than 90 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
There is a range of BIS scores during which sedated patients are able to repeat words read to them but are not able to subsequently recall these words .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , patients had no recall of words repeated prior to procedural sedation in BIS ranges associated with recall after procedural sedation , suggestive of retrograde amnesia .

Assessment of perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention in New Hampshire delivery hospitals .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To evaluate current performance on recommended perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention practices in New Hampshire .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Data were extracted from 2021 paired mother - infant records for the year 2000 birth cohort in New Hampshire 's 25 delivery hospitals .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Assessment was done on the following : prenatal screening for hepatitis B and rubella , administration of the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose to all infants , administration of hepatitis
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
B immune globulin to infants who were born to hepatitis B surface antigen - positive mothers , rubella immunity , and administration of in - hospital postpartum rubella vaccine to
O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rubella nonimmune women .
O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Prenatal screening rates for hepatitis B ( 98 . 8 % ) and rubella ( 99 . 4 % ) were high .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hepatitis B vaccine birth dose was administered to 76 . 2 % of all infants .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All infants who were born to hepatitis B surface antigen - positive mothers also received hepatitis B immune globulin .
O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O
Multivariate logistic regression showed that the month of delivery and infant birth weight were independent predictors of hepatitis B vaccination .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The proportion of infants who were vaccinated in January and February 2000 ( 48 . 5 % and 67 . 5 % , respectively ) was less than any other
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
months , whereas the proportion who were vaccinated in December 2000 ( 88 . 2 % ) was the highest .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Women who were born between 1971 and 1975 had the highest rate of rubella nonimmunity ( 9 . 5 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In - hospital postpartum rubella vaccine administration was documented for 75 . 6 % of nonimmune women .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :

Expression of p300 protects cardiac myocytes from apoptosis in vivo .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Doxorubicin is an anti - tumor agent that represses cardiac - specific gene expression and induces myocardial cell apoptosis .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Doxorubicin depletes cardiac p300 , a transcriptional coactivator that is required for the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of cardiac myocytes .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , the role of p300 in protection against doxorubicin - induced apoptosis is unknown .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Transgenic mice overexpressing p300 in the heart and wild - type mice were subjected to doxorubicin treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Compared with wild - type mice , transgenic mice exhibited higher survival rate as well as more preserved left ventricular function and cardiac expression of alpha - sarcomeric actin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Doxorubicin induced myocardial cell apoptosis in wild - type mice but not in transgenic mice .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Expression of p300 increased the cardiac level of bcl - 2 and mdm - 2 , but not that of p53 or other members of the bcl - 2 family
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
These findings demonstrate that overexpression of p300 protects cardiac myocytes from doxorubicin - induced apoptosis and reduces the extent of acute heart failure in adult mice in vivo .

Mitochondrial DNA and its respiratory chain products are defective in doxorubicin nephrosis .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Doxorubicin induces a self - perpetuating nephropathy characterized by early glomerular and late - onset tubular lesions in rats .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We investigated the potential role of mitochondrial injury in the onset of these lesions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Rats were treated with intravenous doxorubicin ( 1 mg kg ( - 1 ) week ( - 1 ) ) for 7 weeks and were sacrificed either 1 week (
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
' short - term ' ) or 30 weeks ( ' long - term ' ) following the last dose .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Additional rats received a single dose either 6 days or 2 h prior to euthanasia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All rats were killed at 48 weeks of age .
O O O O O O O O O O
Glomerular and tubular injury was monitored and correlated to the activity or expression of respiratory chain components .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Finally , we quantified both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) as well as superoxide production and the 4834 base pair ' common ' mtDNA deletion .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The ' long - term ' group had significant glomerular and tubular lesions , depressed activities of mtDNA - encoded NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome - c oxidase ( COX )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and increased citrate synthase activity .
O O B O O O
In addition , expression of the mtDNA - encoded COX subunit I was reduced and mtDNA levels were decreased .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In ' short - term ' rats , there were fewer tubular lesions , but similar numbers of glomerular lesions activity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Among all animals , glomerular and tubular injury were inversely correlated with mtDNA levels , mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain activities and with the expression of the mtDNA - encoded
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
respiratory chain subunit COX - I . Injury was positively correlated with superoxide production and the activities of nucleus - encoded mitochondrial or cytoplasmic enzymes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Kidneys from the ' long - term ' group showed more mtDNA deletions than in ' short - term ' animals and these were not observed in the other groups
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
These results suggest an important role for quantitative and qualitative mtDNA alterations through the reduction of mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain function and induction of superoxide in doxorubicin - induced

Amphotericin B - induced seizures in a patient with AIDS .
B I O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To report a case of multiple episodes of seizure activity in an AIDS patent following amphotericin B infusion .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O
CASE SUMMARY :
O O O
A 46 - year - old African - American man experienced recurrent grand mal seizures during intravenous infusion of amphotericin B , then petit mal seizures as the infusion was
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O
stopped and the drug concentrations decreased with time .
O O O O O O O O O
The patients concurrent medications included didanosine , hydroxyzine , promethazine , hydrocortisone , and prochlorperazine .
O O O O O B O B O B O B O O B O
Despite administration of phenytoin and lorazepam , the seizures persisted and occurred only during amphotercin B administration .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O B I O O
DISCUSSION :
O O
AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis , both of which the patient had , can potentially cause seizures .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient had a history of alcohol abuse ; alcohol intake as well as withdrawal can also cause seizures .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Didanosine also has a potential for inducing seizures .
B O O O O O O O O
However , these other potential causes of seizure were ruled out .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The time course of events suggested that amphotericin B was the cause of the seizures in this AIDS patient .
O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Amphotericin B seems to be the probable cause of the seizures .
B I O O O O O O O O O O
To date , only three cases of seizures associated with amphotericin B have been reported in the literature , but healthcare providers should be aware of the potential for this

Therapeutic drug monitoring of tobramycin : once - daily versus twice - daily dosage schedules .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the effect of dosage regimen ( once - daily vs . twice - daily ) of tobramicyn on steady - state serum concentrations and toxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
MATERIALS AND METHODS :
O O O O
Patients undergoing treatment with i . v .
O O O O O O O O
tobramycin ( 4 mg / kg / day ) were randomised to two groups .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Group OD ( n = 22 ) received a once - daily dose of tobramycin and group TD ( n = 21 ) received the same dose divided into two
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
doses daily .
O O O
Tobramycin serum concentrations ( peak and trough ) were measured by enzyme multiplied immunoassay .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The renal and auditory functions of the patients were monitored before , during and immediately after treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The two groups were comparable with respect to sex , age , body weight and renal function .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No statistically significant differences were found in mean daily dose , duration of treatment , or cumulative dose .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Trough concentrations were < 2 g / ml in the two groups ( 100 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Peak concentrations were > 6 microg / ml in 100 % of the OD group and in 67 % of the TD group ( P < 0 . 01 )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Mean peak concentrations were markedly different :
O O O O O O O
11 . 00 + / - 2 . 89 microg / ml in OD vs . 6 . 53 + / - 1 . 45 microg / ml in TD
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( P < 0 . 01 ) .
O O O O O O O O
The pharmacokinetics parameters were : Ke , ( 0 . 15 + / - 0 . 03 / h in OD vs . 0 . 24 + / - 0

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Increased serum creatinine was observed in 73 % of patients in OD versus 57 % of patients in TD , without evidence of nephrotoxicity .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In TD group , three patients developed decreased auditory function , of which one presented with an auditory loss of - 30 dB , whereas in the OD group only
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one patient presented decreased auditory function .
O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
This small study suggests that a once - daily dosing regimen of tobramycin is at least as effective as and is no more and possibly less toxic than the twice
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- daily regimen .
O O O O
Using a single - dose therapy , peak concentration determination is not necessary , only trough samples should be monitored to ensure levels below 2 microg / ml .

Chronic effects of a novel synthetic anthracycline derivative ( SM - 5887 ) on normal heart and doxorubicin - induced cardiomyopathy in beagle dogs .
O O O O O O B O O B I I O O O O O B O O O O O O O
This study was designed to investigate the chronic cardiotoxic potential of SM - 5887 and a possible deteriorating effect of SM - 5887 on low - grade cardiotoxicity pre -
O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
induced by doxorubicin in beagle dogs .
O O B O O O O
In the chronic treatment , beagle dogs of each sex were given intravenously once every 3 weeks , either a sublethal dose of doxorubicin ( 1 . 5 mg /
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
kg ) or SM - 5887 ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) .
O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
The experiment was terminated 3 weeks after the ninth dosing .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Animals which received over six courses of doxorubicin demonstrated the electrocardiogram ( ECG ) changes , decrease of blood pressure and high - grade histopathological cardiomyopathy , while animals which
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
were terminally sacrificed after the SM - 5887 administration did not show any changes in ECG , blood pressure and histopathological examinations .
O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To examine a possibly deteriorating cardiotoxic effect of SM - 5887 , low - grade cardiomyopathy was induced in dogs by four courses of doxorubicin ( 1 . 5 mg
O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
/ kg ) .
O O O O
Nine weeks after pre - treatment , dogs were given four courses of either doxorubicin ( 1 . 5 mg / kg ) or SM - 5887 ( 2 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O
5 mg / kg ) once every 3 weeks .
O O O O O O O O O O
The low - grade cardiotoxic changes were enhanced by the additional doxorubicin treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
On the contrary , the SM - 5887 treatment did not progress the grade of cardiomyopathy .
O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
In conclusion , SM - 5887 does not have any potential of chronic cardiotoxicity and deteriorating effect on doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in dogs .

Posteroventral medial pallidotomy in advanced Parkinson 's disease .
O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND : Posteroventral medial pallidotomy sometimes produces striking improvement in patients with advanced Parkinson 's disease , but the studies to date have involved small numbers of patients and short
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- term follow - up .
O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Forty patients with Parkinson 's disease underwent serial , detailed assessments both after drug withdrawal ( """" off """" period ) and while taking their optimal medical regimens ( """"
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on """" period ) .
O O O O O
All patients were examined preoperatively and 39 were examined at six months ; 27 of the patients were also examined at one year , and 11 at two years .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The percent improvements at six months were as follows : off - period score for overall motor function , 28 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 19 to 38
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
percent ) , with most of the improvement in the contralateral limbs ; off - period score for activities of daily living , 29 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, 19 to 39 percent ) ; on - period score for contralateral dyskinesias , 82 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 72 to 91 percent ) ; and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on - period score for ipsilateral dyskinesias , 44 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 29 to 59 percent ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The improvements in dyskinesias and the total scores for off - period parkinsonism , contralateral bradykinesia , and rigidity were sustained in the 11 patients examined at two years .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The improvement in ipsilateral dyskinesias was lost after one year , and the improvements in postural stability and gait lasted only three to six months .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Approximately half the patients who had been dependent on assistance in activities of daily living in the off period before surgery became independent after surgery .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The complications of surgery were generally well tolerated , and there were no significant changes in the use of medication .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
In late - stage Parkinson 's disease , pallidotomy significantly reduces levodopa - induced dyskinesias and off - period disability .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Much of the benefit is sustained at two years , although some improvements , such as those on the ipsilateral side and in axial symptoms , wane within the first
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
year .
O O
The on - period symptoms that are resistant to dopaminergic therapy do not respond to pallidotomy .

Neuropeptide - Y immunoreactivity in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Neuropeptide - Y ( NPY ) is expressed by granule cells and mossy fibres of the hippocampal dentate gyrus during experimental temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This expression may represent an endogenous damping mechanism since NPY has been shown to block seizure - like events following high - frequency stimulation in hippocampal slices .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The pilocarpine ( PILO ) model of epilepsy is characterized by an acute period of status epilepticus followed by spontaneous recurrent seizures and related brain damage .
O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We report peroxidase - antiperoxidase immunostaining for NPY in several brain regions in this model .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PILO - injected animals exhibited NPY immunoreactivity in the region of the mossy fibre terminals , in the dentate gyrus inner molecular layer and , in a few cases ,
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
within presumed granule cells .
O O O O O
NPY immunoreactivity was also dramatically changed in the entorhinal cortex , amygdala and sensorimotor areas .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , PILO injected animals exhibited a reduction in the number of NPY - immunoreactive interneurons compared with controls .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results demonstrate that changes in NPY expression , including expression in the granule cells and mossy fibres and the loss of vulnerable NPY neurons , are present in the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PILO model of TLE .
B O O O O
However , the significance of this changed synthesis of NPY remains to be determined .

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PURPOSE :
O O
To assess by electrophysiologic testing the effect of photorefractive keratectomy ( PRK ) on the retina and optic nerve .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
SETTING :
O O
Eye Clinic , S . Salvatore Hospital , L'Aquila University , Italy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Standard pattern electroretinograms ( P - ERGs ) and standard pattern visual evoked potentials ( P - VEPs ) were done in 25 eyes of 25 patients who had myopic
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PRK for an attempted correction between 5 . 00 and 15 . 00 diopters ( D ) ( mean 8 . 00 D ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Testing was done preoperatively and 3 , 6 , 12 , and 18 months postoperatively .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The contralateral eyes served as controls .
O O O O O O O
During the follow - up , 3 patients ( 12 % ) developed steroid - induced elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) that resolved after corticosteroid therapy was discontinued .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
No statistically significant differences were seen between treated and control eyes nor between treated eyes preoperatively and postoperatively .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Myopic excimer laser PRK did not seem to affect the posterior segment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The transient steroid - induced IOP rise did not seem to cause functional impairment .

Liposomal daunorubicin in advanced Kaposi 's sarcoma : a phase II study .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O
We report a non - randomized Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of liposomal daunorubicin ( DaunoXome ) in the treatment of AIDS related Kaposi 's
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
sarcoma .
O O
Eleven homosexual men with advanced Kaposi 's sarcoma were entered in the trial .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Changes in size , colour and associated oedema of selected ' target ' lesions were measured .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical , biochemical and haematological toxicities were assessed .
O O O O O O O O O
Ten subjects were evaluated .
O O O O O
A partial response was achieved in four , of whom two subsequently relapsed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Stabilization of Kaposi 's sarcoma occurred in the remaining six , maintained until the end of the trial period in four .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The drug was generally well tolerated , with few mild symptoms of toxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The main problem encountered was haematological toxicity , with three subjects experiencing severe neutropenia ( neutrophil count < 0 . 5 x 10 ( 9 ) / l ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was no evidence of cardiotoxicity .
O O O O O O O
In this small patient sample , liposomal daunorubicin was an effective and well tolerated agent in the treatment of Kaposi 's sarcoma .

Failure of ancrod in the treatment of heparin - induced arterial thrombosis .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O
The morbidity and mortality associated with heparin - induced thrombosis remain high despite numerous empirical therapies .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Ancrod has been used successfully for prophylaxis against development of thrombosis in patients with heparin induced platelet aggregation who require brief reexposure to heparin , but its success in patients

Relation of perfusion defects observed with myocardial contrast echocardiography to the severity of coronary stenosis : correlation with thallium - 201 single - photon emission tomography .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
It has been previously shown that myocardial contrast echocardiography is a valuable technique for delineating regions of myocardial underperfusion secondary to coronary occlusion and to critical coronary stenoses in the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
presence of hyperemic stimulation .
O O O O O
The aim of this study was to determine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography performed with a stable solution of sonicated albumin could detect regions of myocardial underperfusion resulting from various degrees
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of coronary stenosis .
O O O O
The perfusion defect produced in 16 open chest dogs was compared with the anatomic area at risk measured by the postmortem dual - perfusion technique and with thallium - 201
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
single - photon emission tomography ( SPECT ) .
O O O O O O O O O
During a transient ( 20 - s ) coronary occlusion , a perfusion defect was observed with contrast echocardiography in 14 of the 15 dogs in which the occlusion was
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
produced .
O O
The perfusion defect correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0 . 74 ; p less than 0 . 002 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
During dipyridamole - induced hyperemia , 12 of the 16 dogs with a partial coronary stenosis had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The four dogs without a perfusion defect had a stenosis that resulted in a mild ( 0 % to 50 % ) reduction in dipyridamole - induced hyperemia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The size of the perfusion defect during stenosis correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0 . 61 ; p = 0 . 02 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thallium - 201 SPECT demonstrated a perfusion defect in all 14 dogs analyzed during dipyridamole - induced hyperemia ; the size of the perfusion defect correlated with the anatomic area
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at risk ( r = 0 . 58 ; p less than 0 . 03 ) and with the perfusion defect by contrast echocardiography ( r = 0 . 58
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
; p less than 0 . 03 ) .
O O O O O O O O O
Thus , myocardial contrast echocardiography can be used to visualize and quantitate the amount of jeopardized myocardium during moderate to severe degrees of coronary stenosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results obtained show a correlation with the anatomic area at risk similar to that obtained with thallium - 201 SPECT .

Potential deleterious effect of furosemide in radiocontrast nephropathy .
O O O O B O O O O
The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of furosemide in addition to intravenous fluids in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
18 patients , referred to a radiocontrast study , considered at risk because of preexisting renal insufficiency , were enrolled in a prospective , randomized , controlled trial , performed

at the secondary care center of a 1 , 100 - bed private university hospital .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition to fluids , the treatment group received furosemide ( mean dose 110 mg ) intravenously 30 min prior to the injection of contrast material .

Everolimus , a derivative of sirolimus , seems to mediate antileukemia effects .
B O O O O B O O O O O O O
We report on a combination of everolimus and tacrolimus in 24 patients ( median age , 62 years ) with either myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ; n = 17 )
O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
or acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ; n = 7 ) undergoing intensive conditioning followed by HSCT from related ( n = 4 ) or unrelated ( n = 20
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) donors .
O O O
All patients engrafted , and only 1 patient experienced grade IV mucositis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nine patients ( 37 % ) developed acute grade II - IV GVHD , and 11 of 17 evaluable patients ( 64 % ) developed chronic extensive GVHD .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Transplantation - associated microangiopathy ( TMA ) occurred in 7 patients ( 29 % ) , with 2 cases of acute renal failure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The study was terminated prematurely because an additional 6 patients ( 25 % ) developed sinusoidal obstruction syndrome ( SOS ) , which was fatal in 2 cases .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
With a median follow - up of 26 months , the 2 - year overall survival rate was 47 % .

Effect of some convulsants on the protective activity of loreclezole and its combinations with valproate or clonazepam in amygdala - kindled rats .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O B O O O O O O
Loreclezole ( 5 mg / kg ) exerted a significant protective action in amygdala - kindled rats , reducing both seizure and afterdischarge durations .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The combinations of loreclezole ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) with valproate , clonazepam , or carbamazepine ( applied at their subprotective doses ) also exhibited antiseizure effect
O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
in this test .
O O O O
However , only two first combinations occurred to be of pharmacodynamic nature .

Acute liver failure with concurrent bupropion and carbimazole therapy .
O O O O O B O B O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To report a case of fatal liver failure possibly associated with concurrent use of bupropion and carbimazole .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
CASE SUMMARY :
O O O
A 41 - year - old Chinese man with a history of hyperthyroidism had been treated with carbimazole and propranolol for the past 5 years .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O
He received a 10 - day course of bupropion as an aid for smoking cessation 10 weeks prior to presentation .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
He developed acute liver failure with rapid deterioration of renal function .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Liver biopsy showed evidence of nonspecific drug - induced acute liver injury .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
His condition was further complicated by sepsis and coagulopathy .

The likelihood that bupropion induced hepatotoxicity in our patient was possible , based on the Naranjo probability scale .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DISCUSSION :
O O
Although there is increasing evidence of hepatotoxicity induced by bupropion , this is the first case of fatality that could have resulted from acute liver failure in a patient receiving
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bupropion while on concomitant treatment with carbimazole .

SELECTION CRITERIA :
O O O
Randomised double - blind trials of HT versus placebo , taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HT included oestrogens , with or without progestogens , via oral , transdermal , subcutaneous or transnasal routes .
O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS :
O O O O O
Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data .
O O O O O O O O O O
MAIN RESULTS :
O O O
Nineteen trials involving 41 , 904 women were included .
O O O O O O O O O O
In relatively healthy women , combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo - embolism or coronary event ( after one year 's use ) , stroke (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after three years ) , breast cancer and gallbladder disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Long - term oestrogen - only HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo - embolism , stroke and gallbladder disease ( after one to two years , three years
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and seven years ' use respectively ) , but did not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and ( for combined HT ) colon cancer , with long - term use .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Among women aged over 65 who were relatively healthy ( i . e . generally fit , without overt disease ) and taking continuous combined HT , there was a
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia .
O O O O O O O O O
Among women with cardiovascular disease , long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo - embolism .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen - only HT , versus similar - sized
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
placebo groups .
O O O
The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thrombo - embolism in women taking combined continuous HT : their absolute risk remained low , at less than 1 /
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
500 .
O O
However , this study was not powered to detect differences between groups of younger women .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS :
O O O O
HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control , though short - term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women .

Passage of mannitol into the brain around gliomas : a potential cause of rebound phenomenon .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A study on 21 patients .
O O O O O O
AIM :
O O
Widespread use of mannitol to reduce brain edema and lower elevated ICP in brain tumor patients continues to be afflicted by the so - called rebound phenomenon .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Leakage of mannitol into the brain parenchyma through an altered BBB and secondary reversal of osmotic gradient is considered the major cause of rebound .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This has only been demonstrated experimentally in animals .
O O O O O O O O O
As a contribution to this issue we decided to research the possible passage of mannitol into the brain after administration to 21 brain tumor patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS : Mannitol ( 18 % solution ; 1 g / kg ) was administered as a bolus to patients ( ten had malignant glioma , seven brain metastases and
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
four meningioma ) about 30 minutes before craniotomy .
O O O O O O O O O
During resection , a sample of the surrounding edematous white matter was taken at the same time as a 10 ml venous blood sample .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mannitol concentrations were measured in plasma and white matter by a modified version of the enzyme assay of Blonquist et al .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
In most glioma patients , mannitol concentrations in white matter were 2 to 6 times higher than in plasma ( mean 3 . 5 times ) .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In meningioma and metastases patients plasma concentrations of mannitol were higher than white matter concentrations except in three cases with infiltration by neoplastic cells .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
The results of our study show that even after a single bolus , mannitol may leak through the altered BBB near gliomas , reversing the initial plasma - to -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
blood osmotic gradient , aggravating peritumoral edema and promoting rebound of ICP .

Following administration of these agents , the presence , and degree of fasciculation were assessed visually on a four point scale by one investigator who was blinded to the drug
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
administered .
O O
The blood pressure and heart rate of each patient were monitored on nine occasions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Twenty - four hours later , any myalgia experienced was assessed according to a structured questionaire and graded by a four point scale by one investigator blinded to the intraoperative
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
management .
O O
The results indicate that muscle fasciculation was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of muscle fasciculation than those in Group PS
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( p < 0 . 001 ) .
O O O O O O O O
At 24 h , the incidence of myalgia was higher in Group PS than in Group LS and PR ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A correlation was not found between the incidence of myalgia and the occurrence of muscle fasciculation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were not significant among the three groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In conclusion , where succinylcholine is used , lidocaine is proven to be the useful pretreatment agent for the reduction of postoperative myalgia .

All patients had a pre - therapy Gram 's stain and culture of sinus exudate obtained by antral puncture or nasal endoscopy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical response was assessed on the basis of signs and symptoms and sinus radiograph or computed tomography results .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Microbiologic cure rates were determined on the basis of presumed plus documented eradication of the pre - therapy pathogen ( s ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :

The most common pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus , and Moraxella catarrhalis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of 300 clinically evaluable patients , 175 ( 58 % ) were cured and 90 ( 30 % ) were improved at the post - therapy evaluation , resulting in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a clinical success rate of 88 % .
O O O O O O O O
Thirty - five patients ( 12 % ) clinically failed treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The microbiologic eradication rate ( presumed plus documented ) among 138 microbiologically evaluable patients was 92 % .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Microbiologic eradication rates ( presumed plus documented ) of the most common pathogens ranged from 93 % ( M . catarrhalis ) to 100 % ( S . pneumoniae )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at the post - therapy visit .

Clinical evaluation on combined administration of oral prostacyclin analogue beraprost and phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol .
O O O O O O O B O B O O O B O
Among various oral antiplatelets , a combination of a novel prostacyclin analogue beraprost ( BPT ) and a potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol ( CLZ ) may result in untoward clinical
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O
effects due to possible synergistic elevation of intracellular cAMP ( cyclic adenosine 3' , 5' - monophosphate ) .
O O O O O O O O B O B I I I I I I O O
Thereby , a clinical study of the combined administration of the two agents was attempted .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Twelve healthy volunteers were assigned to take BPT / CLZ in the following schedule ; BPT : 40 micrograms at day 1 and 120 micrograms t . i . d
O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
. from day 7 to 14 , CLZ : 200 mg t . i . d . from day 3 to 14 .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At various time intervals , physical examination and blood collection for ex vivo platelet aggregation and determination of intraplatelet cAMP were performed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Throughout the observation period , no significant alteration in vital signs was observed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Seven out of 12 subjects experienced headache of a short duration accompanying facial flush in one and nausea in one , especially after ingestion of CLZ .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
All of these symptoms , probably caused by the vasodilating effect of the two agents , were of mild degree and no special treatment was required .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Intraplatelet cAMP content was gradually but significantly increased to 9 . 84 + / -
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 . 59 pmol per 10 ( 9 ) platelets at day 14 in comparison with the initial value ( 6 . 87 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 . 25 pmol ) .
O O O O O O
The platelet aggregability was significantly suppressed at various time intervals but no additive or synergistic inhibitory effect by the combined administration was noted .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In conclusion , the combined administration of BPT / CLZ is safe at doses used in the study , though the beneficial clinical effect of the combined administration has yet

The incidence of EPS - related adverse events , including akathisia , was no different with quetiapine monotherapy ( 12 . 9 % ) than with placebo ( 13 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 % ) .
O O O O
Similarly , EPS - related adverse events with QTP + Li / DVP ( 21 . 4 % ) were no different than with PBO + Li / DVP (
O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
19 . 2 % ) .
O O O O O O
Adverse events related to EPS occurred in 59 . 6 % of patients treated with haloperidol ( n = 99 ) monotherapy , whereas 26 . 5 % of patients
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
treated with lithium ( n = 98 ) monotherapy experienced adverse events related to EPS .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The incidence of akathisia was low and similar with quetiapine monotherapy ( 3 . 3 % ) and placebo ( 6 . 1 % ) , and with QTP +
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Li / DVP ( 3 . 6 % ) and PBO + Li / DVP ( 4 . 9 % ) .
B O B O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O
Lithium was associated with a significantly higher incidence ( p < 0 . 05 ) of tremor ( 18 . 4 % ) than quetiapine ( 5 . 6 %
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
) ; cerebellar tremor , which is a known adverse effect of lithium , may have contributed to the elevated rate of tremor in patients receiving lithium therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Haloperidol induced a significantly higher incidence ( p < 0 . 001 ) of akathisia ( 33 . 3 % versus 5 . 9 % ) , tremor ( 30
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Contribution of the sympathetic nervous system to salt - sensitivity in lifetime captopril - treated spontaneously hypertensive rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To test the hypothesis that , in lifetime captopril - treated spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR ) , the sympathetic nervous system contributes importantly to the hypertensive effect of
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dietary sodium chloride supplementation .
B I I O O
METHODS :
O O
Male SHR ( aged 6 weeks ) that had been treated from conception onward with either captopril or vehicle remained on a basal sodium chloride diet or were fed a
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I O O O O O
high sodium chloride diet .
O B I O O
After 2 weeks , the rats were subjected to ganglionic blockade and 2 days later , an infusion of clonidine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
RESULTS :
O O
Lifetime captopril treatment significantly lowered mean arterial pressure in both groups .
O B O O O O O O O O O O
Intravenous infusion of the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium resulted in a rapid decline in MAP that eliminated the dietary sodium chloride - induced increase in MAP in both groups .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
Infusion of the central nervous system alpha2 - adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine also resulted in a greater reduction in MAP in both groups of SHR that were fed the high
O O O O O O B I I I I B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( compared with the basal ) sodium chloride diet .
O O O O O O B I O O
CONCLUSIONS :

Possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome related to concomitant treatment with paroxetine and alprazolam .
O O O O O O O O O B O B O
A 74 - year - old man with depressive symptoms was admitted to a psychiatric hospital due to insomnia , loss of appetite , exhaustion , and agitation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Medical treatment was initiated at a daily dose of 20 mg paroxetine and 1 . 2 mg alprazolam .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O
On the 10th day of paroxetine and alprazolam treatment , the patient exhibited marked psychomotor retardation , disorientation , and severe muscle rigidity with tremors .
O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient had a fever ( 38 . 2 degrees C ) , fluctuating blood pressure ( between 165 / 90 and 130 / 70 mg mm Hg ) ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and severe extrapyramidal symptoms .
O O O O O
Laboratory tests showed an elevation of creatine phosphokinase ( 2218 IU / L ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( 134 IU / L ) , alanine aminotransferase ( 78 IU /
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient received bromocriptine and diazepam to treat his symptoms .
O O O B O B O O O O O
7 days later , the fever disappeared and the patient 's serum CPK levels were normalized ( 175 IU / L ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This patient presented with symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( NMS ) , thus demonstrating that NMS - like symptoms can occur after combined paroxetine and alprazolam treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O
The adverse drug reaction score obtained by the Naranjo algorithm was 6 in our case , indicating a probable relationship between the patient 's NMS - like adverse symptoms and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the combined treatment used in this case .
O O O O O O O O
The involvement of physiologic and environmental aspects specific to this patient was suspected .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Several risk factors for NMS should be noted in elderly depressive patients whose symptoms often include dehydration , agitation , malnutrition , and exhaustion .

Pilocarpine seizures cause age - dependent impairment in auditory location discrimination .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
Children who have status epilepticus have continuous or rapidly repeating seizures that may be life - threatening and may cause life - long changes in brain and behavior .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The extent to which status epilepticus causes deficits in auditory discrimination is unknown .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A naturalistic auditory location discrimination method was used to evaluate this question using an animal model of status epilepticus .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Male Sprague - Dawley rats were injected with saline on postnatal day ( P ) 20 , or a convulsant dose of pilocarpine on P20 or P45 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Pilocarpine on either day induced status epilepticus ; status epilepticus at P45 resulted in CA3 cell loss and spontaneous seizures , whereas P20 rats had no cell loss or spontaneous
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seizures .
O O
Mature rats were trained with sound - source location and sound - silence discriminations .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Control ( saline P20 ) rats acquired both discriminations immediately .
O O O O O O O O O O O
In status epilepticus ( P20 ) rats , acquisition of the sound - source location discrimination was moderately impaired .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Status epilepticus ( P45 ) rats failed to acquire either sound - source location or sound - silence discriminations .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Status epilepticus in rat causes an age - dependent , long - term impairment in auditory discrimination .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This impairment may explain one cause of impaired auditory location discrimination in humans .

Cardiovascular risk with cyclooxygenase inhibitors : general problem with substance specific differences ?
O O O B I O O O O O O O O
Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction , stroke , hypertension and heart failure during treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly , but not exclusively , in patients with concomitant risk factors .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cyclooxygenase inhibitors cause complex changes in renal , vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A comparison of individual selective and unselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests substance - specific differences , which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed
O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by prostaglandin - independent effects .

Predictors of decreased renal function in patients with heart failure during angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor therapy : results from the studies of left ventricular dysfunction ( SOLVD ) BACKGROUND
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
: Although angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor therapy reduces mortality rates in patients with congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , it may also cause decreased renal function .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Little information is available to predict which patients are at highest risk for this complication .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To quantify specific clinical predictors of reduction in renal function in patients with CHF who are prescribed angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
METHOD :
O O
We analyzed data from the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction ( SOLVD ) , a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of enalapril for the treatment
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
of CHF .
O O O
There were 3379 patients randomly assigned to enalapril with a median follow - up of 974 days and 3379 patients randomly assigned to placebo with a mean follow - up
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of 967 days .
O O O O
Decreased renal function was defined as a rise in serum creatinine > / = 0 . 5 mg / dL ( 44 micromol / L ) from baseline .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We used time - to - event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age , baseline ejection fraction , baseline creatinine , low systolic blood
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
pressure ( < 100 mm Hg ) , history of hypertension , diabetes , and use of antiplatelet , diuretic , and beta - blocker therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Patients randomly assigned to enalapril had a 33 % greater likelihood of decreased renal function than controls ( P = . 003 ) .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
By multivariate analysis , in both the placebo and enalapril groups older age , diuretic therapy , and diabetes were associated with decreased renal function , whereas beta - blocker
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective .
O O O O O O O O
Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing decreased renal function in both groups , but significantly more so in the enalapril group ( enalapril : risk ratio

Pemoline induced acute choreoathetosis : case report and review of the literature .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND : Pemoline is an oxazolidine derivative that is structurally different from amphetamines and used in the treatment of attention deficit disorder .
O O B O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Pemoline has not been commonly associated in the literature as a cause of acute movement disorders .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The following case describes two children acutely poisoned with pemoline who experienced profound choreoathetosis .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
CASE REPORT :
O O O
Two , 3 - year - old male , identical twin siblings presented to the emergency department after found playing with a an empty bottle of pemoline originally containing 59
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
tablets .
O O
The children had a medical history significant for attention deficit disorder previously treated with methylphenidate without success .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
This was their first day of pemoline therapy .
O O O O O O B O O
The choreoathetoid movements began 45 min to 1 h after ingestion .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The children gave no history of prior movement disorders and there was no family history of movement disorders .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The children received gastrointestinal decontamination and high doses of intravenous benzodiazepines in an attempt to control the choreoathetoid movements .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Despite treatment , the children continued to have choreoathetosis for approximately 24 hours .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Forty - eight hours after admission , the children appeared to be at their baseline and were discharged home .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Pemoline associated movement disorder has been rarely reported in the acute toxicology literature .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The possibility of choreoathetoid movements should be considered in patients presenting after pemoline overdose .

Continuous subcutaneous administration of mesna to prevent ifosfamide - induced hemorrhagic cystitis .
O O O O B O O B O O O O O
Hemorrhagic cystitis is a major potential toxicity of ifosfamide that can be prevented by administering mesna along with the cytotoxic agent .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Mesna is generally administered by the intravenous route , although experience with oral delivery of the drug has increased .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The continuous subcutaneous administration of mesna has the advantage of not requiring intravenous access .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
In addition , subcutaneous delivery of the neutralizing agent will not be associated with the risk of inadequate urinary mesna concentrations , such as in a patient taking oral
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
mesna who experiences severe ifosfamide - induced emesis and is unable to absorb the drug .
B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Limited clinical experience with continuous subcutaneous mesna administration suggests it is a safe , practical , and economic method of drug delivery that permits ifosfamide to be administered successfully in
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
the outpatient setting .

Modification of drug action by hyperammonemia .
O O O O O O O
Pretreatment with ammonium acetate ( NH4Ac ) ( 6 mmol / kg s . c . ) approximately doubled the time morphine - treated mice remained on a hot surface
O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
and similarly increased muscular incoordination by diazepam , but NH4Ac treatment alone had no effect .
O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O
Thus , hyperammonemia is capable of altering drug action and must be considered along with impaired drug metabolism in enhanced drug responses associated with liver disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Experiments in vitro showed that acetylcholine - induced catecholamine release from bovine adrenal medulla is depressed as much as 50 % by 0 . 3 mM NH4Ac and KCl -
O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
induced contractions of guinea - pig ileum were inhibited 20 % by 5 mM NH4Ac .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Addition of excess calcium reversed the depression in both tissues , but calcium - independent catecholamine release by acetaldehyde was not blocked by NH4Ac .
O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O B O O B O O O O B O
These results suggested that ammonia blocks calcium channels .
O O O O B O B O O
Parallels in the actions of NH4Ac and the calcium channel blocker verapamil support this concept .
O O O O O B O O B O O B O O O O
Both verapamil ( 10 mg / kg i . p . )
O B O O O O O O O O O O
and NH4Ac pretreatment enhanced morphine
O B O O B
analgesia - and diazepam - induced muscular incoordination and antagonized amphetamine - induced motor activity , and neither verapamil nor NH4Ac affected the convulsant action of metrazol .
O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O B O
The data suggest that hyperammonemia exerts a calcium channel blocking action which enhances the effects of central nervous system depressants and certain opioid analgesics .

Risk of nephropathy after consumption of nonionic contrast media by children undergoing cardiac angiography : a prospective study .
O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
Despite increasing reports on nonionic contrast media - induced nephropathy ( CIN ) in hospitalized adult patients during cardiac procedures , the studies in pediatrics are limited , with even
O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
less focus on possible predisposing factors and preventive measures for patients undergoing cardiac angiography .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This prospective study determined the incidence of CIN for two nonionic contrast media ( CM ) , iopromide and iohexol , among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared
O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of CM and the presence of cyanosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The 80 patients in the study consecutively received either iopromide ( group A , n = 40 ) or iohexol ( group B , n = 40 ) .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Serum sodium ( Na ) , potassium ( K ) , and creatinine ( Cr ) were measured 24 h before angiography as baseline values , then measured again at
O B O B O O B O B O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
12 - , 24 - , and 48 - h intervals after CM use .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Urine samples for Na and Cr also were checked at the same intervals .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O
Risk of renal failure , Injury to the kidney , Failure of kidney function , Loss of kidney function , and End - stage renal damage ( RIFLE criteria )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
were used to define CIN and its incidence in the study population .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Accordingly , among the 15 CIN patients ( 18 . 75 % ) , 7 . 5 % of the patients in group A had increased risk and 3 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
75 % had renal injury , whereas 5 % of group B had increased risk and 2 . 5 % had renal injury .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Whereas 33 . 3 % of the patients with CIN were among those who received the proper dosage of CM , the percentage increased to 66 . 6 % among
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
those who received larger doses , with a significant difference in the incidence of CIN related to the different dosages of CM ( p = 0 . 014 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Among the 15 patients with CIN , 6 had cyanotic congenital heart diseases , but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the noncyanotic patients ( p =
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
0 . 243 ) .
O O O O O
Although clinically silent , CIN is not rare in pediatrics .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic CM , nor on the presence of cyanosis , and although CIN usually is reversible , more
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children .

A case of ventricular tachycardia related to caffeine pretreatment .
O O O O O O O B O O
Suboptimal seizure duration is commonly encountered in electroconvulsive therapy practice , especially in older patients with higher seizure thresholds .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Intravenous caffeine is commonly used to improve seizure duration and quality in such patients and is generally well tolerated aside from occasional reports of relatively benign ventricular ectopy .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We describe a patient with no previous history of cardiac disease or arrhythmia who developed sustained bigeminy and 2 brief runs of ventricular tachycardia after caffeine administration .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Although intravenous caffeine is generally well tolerated , the clinician should be aware of the potential for unpredictable and serious ventricular arrhythmias .

Optical coherence tomography can measure axonal loss in patients with ethambutol - induced optic neuropathy .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
PURPOSE :
O O
To map and identify the pattern , in vivo , of axonal degeneration in ethambutol - induced optic neuropathy using optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ethambutol is an antimycobacterial agent often used to treat tuberculosis .
B O O O O O O O O O O
A serious complication of ethambutol is an optic neuropathy that impairs visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , and color vision .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , early on , when the toxic optic neuropathy is mild and partly reversible , the funduscopic findings are often subtle and easy to miss .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Three subjects with a history of ethambutol ( EMB ) - induced optic neuropathy of short - , intermediate - , and long - term visual deficits were administered a
O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
full neuro - ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity , color vision , contrast sensitivity , and fundus examination .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , OCT ( OCT 3000 , Humphrey - Zeiss , Dublin , CA ) was performed on both eyes of each subject using the retinal nerve fiber layer
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( RNFL ) analysis protocol .
O O O O O O
OCT interpolates data from 100 points around the optic nerve to effectively map out the RNFL .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The results were compared to the calculated average RNFL of normal eyes accumulated from four prior studies using OCT , n = 661 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In all subjects with history of EMB - induced optic neuropathy , there was a mean loss of 72 % nerve fiber layer thickness in the temporal quadrant ( patient
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A , with eventual recovery of visual acuity and fields , 58 % loss ; patient B , with intermediate visual deficits , 68 % loss ; patient C ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with chronic visual deficits , 90 % loss ) , with an average mean optic nerve thickness of 26 + / - 16 microm .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was a combined mean loss of 46 % of fibers from the superior , inferior , and nasal quadrants in the ( six ) eyes of all three subjects
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( mean average thickness of 55 + / - 29 microm ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In both sets ( four ) of eyes of the subjects with persistent visual deficits ( patients B and C ) , there was an average loss of 79 %
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of nerve fiber thickness in the temporal quadrant .
O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
The OCT results in these patients with EMB - induced optic neuropathy show considerable loss especially of the temporal fibers .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is consistent with prior histopathological studies that show predominant loss of parvo - cellular axons ( or small - caliber axons ) within the papillo - macular bundle in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
toxic or hereditary optic neuropathies .
O O O O O O
OCT can be a valuable tool in the quantitative analysis of optic neuropathies .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Additionally , in terms of management of EMB - induced optic neuropathy , it is important to properly manage ethambutol dosing in patients with renal impairment and to achieve proper
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
transition to a maintenance dose once an appropriate loading dose has been reached .

Effects of the cyclooxygenase - 2 specific inhibitor valdecoxib versus nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and placebo on cardiovascular thrombotic events in patients with arthritis .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There have been concerns that the risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events may be higher with cyclooxygenase ( COX ) - 2 - specific inhibitors than nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
NSAIDs ) .
O O O
We evaluated cardiovascular event data for valdecoxib , a new COX - 2 - specific inhibitor in approximately 8000 patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis treated with this agent in
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
randomized clinical trials .
O O O O
The incidence of cardiovascular thrombotic events ( cardiac , cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular , or arterial thrombotic ) was determined by analyzing pooled valdecoxib ( 10 - 80 mg daily
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
) , nonselective NSAID ( diclofenac 75 mg bid , ibuprofen 800 mg tid , or naproxen 500 mg bid ) and placebo data from 10 randomized osteoarthritis and rheumatoid
O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
arthritis trials that were 6 - 52 weeks in duration .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The incidence rates of events were determined in all patients ( n = 7934 ) and in users of low - dose ( < or = 325 mg daily )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
aspirin ( n = 1051 ) and nonusers of aspirin ( n = 6883 ) .
B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Crude and exposure - adjusted incidences of thrombotic events were similar for valdecoxib , NSAIDs , and placebo .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The risk of serious thrombotic events was also similar for each valdecoxib dose .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Thrombotic risk was consistently higher for users of aspirin users than nonusers of aspirin ( placebo , 1 . 4 % vs . 0 % ; valdecoxib , 1 .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
7 % vs . 0 . 2 % ; NSAIDs , 1 . 9 % vs . 0 . 5 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The rates of events in users of aspirin were similar for all 3 treatment groups and across valdecoxib doses .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O
Short - and intermediate - term treatment with therapeutic ( 10 or 20 mg daily ) and supratherapeutic ( 40 or 80 mg daily ) valdecoxib doses was not associated
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
with an increased incidence of thrombotic events relative to nonselective NSAIDs or placebo in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients in controlled clinical trials .

The objective of this study was to determine whether ephedrine , an alpha - and beta - adrenergic agonist previously shown to enhance genital blood flow in women , has
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
beneficial effects in reversing antidepressant - induced sexual dysfunction .
O O O O O O O O O O
Nineteen sexually dysfunctional women receiving either fluoxetine , sertraline , or paroxetine participated in an eight - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled , cross - over
O O O O O O B O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
study of the effects of ephedrine ( 50 mg ) on self - report measures of sexual desire , arousal , orgasm , and sexual satisfaction .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although there were significant improvements relative to baseline in sexual desire and orgasm intensity / pleasure on 50 mg ephedrine 1 - hr prior to sexual activity , significant improvements
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
in these measures , as well as in sexual arousal and orgasmic ability also were noted with placebo .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings highlight the importance of conducting placebo - controlled trials for this condition .

Erectile dysfunction occurs following substantia nigra lesions in the rat .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Erectile function was assessed 6 weeks following uni - and bilateral injections of 6 - hydroxydopamine in the substantia nigra nucleus of the brain .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
Behavioral apomorphine - induced penile erections were reduced ( 5 / 8 ) and increased ( 3 / 8 ) in uni - and bilateral lesioned animals .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Intracavernous pressures , following electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve , decreased in lesioned animals .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lesions of the substantia nigra were confirmed by histology .
O O O O O O O O O O
Concentration of dopamine and its metabolites were decreased in the striatum of substantia nigra lesioned rats .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lesions of the substantia nigra are therefore associated with erectile dysfunction in rats and may serve as a model to study erectile dysfunction in Parkinson 's disease .

Deaths from local anesthetic - induced convulsions in mice .
O O O O O O O O O O
Median convulsant ( CD50 ) and median lethal
O O O O O O O O
( LD50 ) doses of three representative local anesthetics were determined in adult mice to evaluate the threat to life of local anesthetic - induced convulsions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The CD50 and LD50 , respectively , were 57 . 7 and 58 . 7 mg / kg for bupivacaine , 111 . 0 and 133 . 1 mg /
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
kg for lidocaine , and 243 . 4 and 266 . 5 mg / kg for chloroprocaine .

Convulsions always preceded death , except after precipitous cardiopulmonary arrest from extreme doses .

the chloroprocaine group , and in 6 % of the lidocaine group .

The narrow gap between convulsant and lethal doses of local anesthetics indicates that untreated convulsions present much more of a threat to life than heretofore appreciated .

Myoclonic , atonic , and absence seizures following institution of carbamazepine therapy in children .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Five children , aged 3 to 11 years , treated with carbamazepine for epilepsy , had an acute aberrant reaction characterized by the onset of myoclonic , atypical absence and
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
/ or atonic ( minor motor ) seizures within a few days .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When the carbamazepine was discontinued , two of the children returned to their former state very quickly , two had the minor motor seizures resolve in 3 and 6 months

Naloxone reversal of hypotension due to captopril overdose .
B O O O O O B O O
The hemodynamic effects of captopril and other angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors may be mediated by the endogenous opioid system .
O O O O B O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O
The opioid antagonist naloxone has been shown to block or reverse the hypotensive actions of captopril .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O
We report a case of an intentional captopril overdose , manifested by marked hypotension , that resolved promptly with the administration of naloxone .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
To our knowledge , this is the first reported case of captopril - induced hypotension treated with naloxone .

Carbamazepine - induced cardiac dysfunction .
B O O O O O
Characterization of two distinct clinical syndromes .
O O O O O O O
A patient with sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular block , induced by carbamazepine , prompted an extensive literature review of all previously reported cases .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
From the analysis of these cases , two distinct forms of carbamazepine - associated cardiac dysfunction emerged .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
One patient group developed sinus tachycardias in the setting of a massive carbamazepine
O O O O O O O O O O O O B
overdose .
O O
The second group consisted almost exclusively of elderly women who developed potentially life - threatening bradyarrhythmias or atrioventricular conduction delay , associated with either therapeutic or modestly elevated carbamazepine serum
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
levels .
O O
Because carbamazepine is widely used in the treatment of many neurologic and psychiatric conditions , the recognition of the latter syndrome has important implications for the use of this drug

in elderly patients .

Glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by NMDA receptors in the inferior colliculus can modulate haloperidol - induced catalepsy .
O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O
The inferior colliculus ( IC ) is primarily involved in the processing of auditory information , but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with structures of the motor system .
O O O O O O O
Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory amino acid microinjection causes freezing , escape -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
like behavior , and immobility .
O O O O O O
However , the nature of this immobility is still unclear .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The present study examined the influence of excitatory amino acid - mediated mechanisms in the IC on the catalepsy induced by the dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol administered systemically ( 1
O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O
or 0 . 5 mg / kg ) in rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Haloperidol - induced catalepsy was challenged with prior intracollicular microinjections of glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists , MK - 801
B O O O O O O O O O O B B O O O B I I
( 15 or 30 mmol / 0 . 5 microl ) and AP7 ( 10 or 20 nmol / 0 . 5 microl ) , or of the NMDA receptor
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
agonist N - methyl - d - aspartate ( NMDA , 20 or 30 nmol / 0 . 5 microl ) .
O B I I I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results showed that intracollicular microinjection of MK - 801 and AP7 previous to systemic injections of haloperidol significantly attenuated the catalepsy , as indicated by a reduced latency to
O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
step down from a horizontal bar .
O O O O O O O
Accordingly , intracollicular microinjection of NMDA increased the latency to step down the bar .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
These findings suggest that glutamate - mediated mechanisms in the neural circuits at the IC level influence haloperidol - induced catalepsy and participate in the regulation of motor activity .

Metabotropic glutamate 7 receptor subtype modulates motor symptoms in rodent models of Parkinson 's disease .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Metabotropic glutamate ( mGlu ) receptors modulate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and represent promising therapeutic targets for symptomatic treatment of Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Among the eight mGlu receptor subtypes , mGlu7 receptor is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia , but its role in restoring motor function in animal models of PD is
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not known .
O O O
The effects of N , N' - dibenzhydrylethane - 1 , 2 - diamine dihydrochloride ( AMN082 ) , the first selective allosteric activator of mGlu7 receptors , were thus
O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
tested in different rodent models of PD .
O O O O O O O O
Here , we show that oral ( 5 mg / kg ) or intrastriatal administration ( 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 nmol ) of AMN082 reverses haloperidol -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
induced catalepsy in rats .
O O O O O
AMN082 ( 2 . 5 and 5 mg / kg ) reduces apomorphine - induced rotations in unilateral 6 - hydroxydopamine ( 6 - OHDA ) - lesioned rats .
B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O
In a more complex task commonly used to evaluate major akinetic symptoms of PD patients , 5 mg / kg AMN082 reverses the increased reaction time to respond to a
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
cue of bilateral 6 - OHDA - lesioned rats .
O O O B I I O O O O
In addition , AMN082 reduces the duration of haloperidol - induced catalepsy in a mGlu7 receptor - dependent manner in wild - type but not mGlu7 receptor knockout mice .
O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Higher doses of AMN082 ( 10 and 20 mg / kg p . o . ) have no effect on the same models of PD .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Overall these findings suggest that mGlu7 receptor activation can reverse motor dysfunction associated with reduced dopamine activity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Selective ligands of mGlu7 receptor subtypes may thus be considered as promising compounds for the development of antiparkinsonian therapeutic strategies .

Nimodipine prevents memory impairment caused by nitroglycerin - induced hypotension in adult mice .
B O O O O O B O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND : Hypotension and a resultant decrease in cerebral blood flow have been implicated in the development of cognitive dysfunction .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We tested the hypothesis that nimodipine ( NIMO ) administered at the onset of nitroglycerin ( NTG ) - induced hypotension would preserve long - term associative memory .

CONCLUSION :
O O
In a PA retention paradigm , the injection of NTG immediately after learning produced a significant impairment of long - term associative memory in mice , whereas delayed induced hypotension
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
had no effect .
O O O O
NIMO attenuated the disruption in consolidation of long - term memory caused by NTG but did not improve latency in the absence of hypotension .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
The observed effect of NIMO may have been attributable to the preservation of calcium homeostasis during hypotension , because there were no differences in the PbtO ( 2 ) indices

among groups .

Fatal haemopericardium and gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to possible interaction of cranberry juice with warfarin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
We report a case of fatal internal haemorrhage in an elderly man who consumed only cranberry juice for two weeks while maintaining his usual dosage of warfarin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
We propose that naturally occurring compounds such as flavonoids , which are present in fruit juices , may increase the potency of warfarin by competing for the enzymes that normally
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
inactivate warfarin .

While traditionally regarded as foodstuffs , consumption of fruit juices should be considered when patients develop adverse drug reactions .

Isoproterenol induces primary loss of dystrophin in rat hearts : correlation with myocardial injury .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mechanism of isoproterenol - induced myocardial damage is unknown , but a mismatch of oxygen supply vs . demand following coronary hypotension and myocardial hyperactivity is the best explanation
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the complex morphological alterations observed .
O O O O O O O
Severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes have been demonstrated to be caused by isoproterenol .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Taking into account that the sarcolemmal integrity is stabilized by the dystrophin - glycoprotein complex ( DGC ) that connects actin and laminin in contractile machinery and extracellular matrix and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by integrins , this study tests the hypothesis that isoproterenol affects sarcolemmal stability through changes in the DGC and integrins .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
We found different sensitivity of the DGC and integrin to isoproterenol subcutaneous administration .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Immunofluorescent staining revealed that dystrophin is the most sensitive among the structures connecting the actin in the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sarcomeric actin dissolution occurred after the reduction or loss of dystrophin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Subsequently , after lysis of myofilaments , gamma - sarcoglycan , beta - dystroglycan , beta1 - integrin , and laminin alpha - 2 expressions were reduced followed by their
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
breakdown , as epiphenomena of the myocytolytic process .
O O O O O O O O O
In conclusion , administration of isoproterenol to rats results in primary loss of dystrophin , the most sensitive among the structural proteins that form the DGC that connects the extracellular
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
matrix and the cytoskeleton in cardiomyocyte .
O O O O O O O
These changes , related to ischaemic injury , explain the severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes and hence severe and irreversible injury induced by
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
isoproterenol .

Often , chemotherapy by doxorubicin ( Adriamycin ) is limited due to life threatening cardiotoxicity in patients during and posttherapy .
O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recently , we have shown that moderate diet restriction remarkably protects against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
This cardioprotection is accompanied by decreased cardiac oxidative stress and triglycerides and increased cardiac fatty - acid oxidation , ATP synthesis , and upregulated JAK / STAT3 pathway .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
In the current study , we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40 % high fat diet ( HFD ) , which induces obesity in male Sprague - Dawley

rats ( 250 - 275 g ) , sensitizes to doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
A LD ( 10 ) dose ( 8 mg doxorubicin / kg , ip ) administered on day 43 of the HFD feeding regimen led to higher cardiotoxicity , cardiac

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Doxorubicin toxicokinetics studies revealed no change in accumulation of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol ( toxic metabolite ) in the normal diet - fed ( ND ) and OB hearts .
B O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mechanistic studies revealed that OB rats are sensitized due to : ( 1 ) higher oxyradical stress leading to upregulation of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 , ( 2 )

In conclusion , HFD - induced obese rats are highly sensitized to doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity by substantially downregulating cardiac mitochondrial ATP generation , increasing oxidative stress and downregulating the

Methanolic extracts from Pueraria thunbergiana exhibited an activation effect ( 46 % ) on ChAT in vitro .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Via the sequential isolation of Pueraria thunbergiana , the active component was ultimately identified as daidzein ( 4' , 7 - dihydroxy - isoflavone ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I I I I I O O
In order to investigate the effects of daidzein from Pueraria thunbergiana on scopolamine - induced impairments of learning and memory , we conducted a series of in vivo tests .
O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Administration of daidzein ( 4 . 5 mg / kg body weight ) to mice was shown significantly to reverse scopolamine - induced amnesia , according to the results of
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
a Y - maze test .
O O O O O O
Injections of scopolamine into mice resulted in impaired performance on Y - maze tests ( a 37 % decreases in alternation behavior ) .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
By way of contrast , mice treated with daidzein prior to the scopolamine injections were noticeably protected from this performance impairment ( an approximately 12 % - 21 % decrease
O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in alternation behavior ) .
O O O O O
These results indicate that daidzein might play a role in acetylcholine biosynthesis as a ChAT activator , and that it also ameliorates scopolamine - induced amnesia .

Possible azithromycin - associated hiccups .
O B O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To report a case of persistent hiccups associated by azithromycin therapy .
O O O O O O O O O B O O
CASE SUMMARY :
O O O
A 76 - year - old man presented with persistent hiccups after beginning azithromycin for the treatment of pharyngitis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Hiccups were persistent and exhausting .
O O O O O O
Discontinuation of azithromycin and therapy with baclofen finally resolved hiccups .
O O B O O O B O O O O
No organic cause of hiccups was identified despite extensive investigation .
O O O O O O O O O O O
DISCUSSION :
O O
Pharmacotherapeutic agents have been uncommonly associated with hiccups .
O O O O O O O O O
Corticosteroids ( dexamethasone and methylprednisolone ) , benzodiazepines ( midazolam ) and general anaesthesia have been the specific agents mentioned most frequently in the literature as being associated with the
O O B O B O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
development of hiccups .
O O O O
Few cases of drug - induced hiccups have been reported related to macrolide antimicrobials .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Using the Naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible ( score 5 points ) , mostly because of the close temporal sequence , previous
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
reports on this reaction with other macrolides and the absence of any alternative explanation for hiccups .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Our hypothesis is that a vagal mechanism mediated by azithromycin could be the pathogenesis of hiccups in our patient .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Diagnosis of drug - induced hiccups is difficult and often achieved only by a process of elimination .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , macrolide antimicrobials have been reported to be associated with hiccups and vagal mechanism could explain the development of this side - effect .

Glyceryl trinitrate induces attacks of migraine without aura in sufferers of migraine with aura .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Migraine with aura and migraine without aura have the same pain phase , thus indicating that migraine with aura and migraine without aura share a common pathway of nociception .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In recent years , increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule nitric oxide ( NO ) is involved in pain mechanisms of migraine without aura .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O
In order to clarify whether the same is true for migraine with aura , in the present study we examined the headache response to intravenous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
GTN ) ( 0 . 5 microg / kg / min for 20 min ) in 12 sufferers of migraine with aura .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The specific aim was to elucidate whether an aura and / or an attack of migraine without aura could be induced .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fourteen healthy subjects served as controls .
O O O O O O O
Aura symptoms were not elicited in any subject .
O O O O O O O O O
Headache was more severe in migraineurs than in the controls during and immediately after GTN infusion ( p = 0 . 037 ) as well as during the following 11
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
h ( p = 0 . 008 ) .
O O O O O O O O O
In the controls , the GTN - induced headache gradually disappeared , whereas in migraineurs peak headache intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post - infusion .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At this time the induced headache in 6 of 12 migraineurs fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for migraine without aura of the International Headache Society .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results therefore suggest that NO is involved in the pain mechanisms of migraine with aura .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Since cortical spreading depression has been shown to liberate NO in animals , this finding may help our understanding of the coupling between cortical spreading depression and headache in migraine
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with aura .

We attempted to identify all incident strokes in women ages 15 - 44 years during a 3 - year period using hospital admission and discharge records , emergency department logs
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, and payment requests for out - of - plan hospitalizations .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
We selected controls , matched on age and facility of usual care , at random from healthy members of the health plan .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We obtained information in face - to - face interviews .
O O O O O O O O O O O
There were 347 confirmed stroke cases and 1 , 021 controls .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The univariate matched odds ratio for stroke in women who admitted to using cocaine and / or amphetamine was 8 . 5 ( 95 % confidence interval = 3 .

6 - 20 . 0 ) .
O O O O O O O
After further adjustment for potential confounders , the odds ratio in women who reported using cocaine and / or amphetamine was 7 . 0 ( 95 % confidence interval =

Prevention of breast cancer with tamoxifen : preliminary findings from the Italian randomised trial among hysterectomised women .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Italian Tamoxifen Prevention Study .
O B O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Tamoxifen is a candidate chemopreventive agent in breast cancer , although the drug may be associated with the development of endometrial cancer .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore we did a trial in hysterectomised women of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
METHODS :
O O
In October , 1992 , we started a double - blind placebo - controlled , randomised trial of tamoxifen in women ( mainly in Italy ) who did not have
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
breast cancer and who had had a hysterectomy .
O O O O O O O O O
Women were randomised to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day or placebo , both orally for 5 years .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years ' follow - up .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In June , 1997 , the trialists and the data - monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recruitment ended on July 11 , 1997 , and the study will continue as planned .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The primary endpoints are the occurrence of and deaths from breast cancer .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This preliminary interim analysis is based on intention - to - treat .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
FINDINGS :
O O
5408 women were randomised ; participating women have a median follow - up of 46 months for major endpoints .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
41 cases of breast cancer occurred so far ; there have been no deaths from breast cancer .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There is no difference in breast - cancer frequency between the placebo ( 22 cases ) and tamoxifen ( 19 ) arms .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
There is a statistically significant reduction of breast cancer among women receiving tamoxifen who also used hormone - replacement therapy during the trial : among 390 women on such therapy
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and allocated to placebo , we found eight cases of breast cancer compared with one case among 362 women allocated to tamoxifen .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Compared with the placebo group , there was a significantly increased risk of vascular events and hypertriglyceridaemia among women on tamoxifen .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
INTERPRETATION :
O O
Although this preliminary analysis has low power , in this cohort of women at low - to - normal risk of breast cancer , the postulated protective effects of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
tamoxifen are not yet apparent .
B O O O O O
Women using hormone - replacement therapy appear to have benefited from use of tamoxifen .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
There were no deaths from breast cancer recorded in women in the study .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is essential to continue follow - up to quantify the long - term risks and benefits of tamoxifen therapy .

Comparison of the effectiveness of ranitidine and cimetidine in inhibiting acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states .
O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O
The H2 - histamine receptor antagonists ranitidine and cimetidine were compared for their abilities to control gastric acid hypersecretion on a short - and long - term basis in 22
O O O B O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
patients with gastric acid hypersecretory states .
O O O O O O O
Nineteen patients had Zollinger - Ellison syndrome , one patient had systemic mastocytosis , and two patients had idiopathic hypersecretion .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The rates of onset of the action of cimetidine and ranitidine were the same .
O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O
The actions of both drugs were increased by anticholinergic agents , and there was a close correlation between the daily maintenance dose of each drug needed to control acid secretion
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
However , ranitidine was threefold more potent than cimetidine both in acute inhibition studies and in the median maintenance dose needed ( 1 . 2 g per day for
O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ranitidine and 3 . 6 g per day for cimetidine ) .
B O O O O O O O O B O O
Sixty percent of the males developed breast changes or impotence while taking cimetidine and in all cases these changes disappeared when cimetidine was replaced by ranitidine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O B O
Treatment with high doses of cimetidine ( one to 60 months ; median , 11 months ) or ranitidine ( two to 31 months ; median , 14 months )
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
was not associated with hepatic or hematologic toxicity or alterations of serum gastrin concentrations , but ranitidine therapy was associated with a significantly lower serum creatinine level than seen with
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O
cimetidine therapy .
B O O
The results show that both drugs can adequately inhibit acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both are safe at high doses , but ranitidine is threefold more potent and does not cause the antiandrogen side effects frequently seen with high doses of cimetidine .

A catch in the Reye .
O O O O O O
Twenty - six cases of Reye syndrome from The Children 's Hospital , Camperdown , Australia , occurring between 1973 and 1982 were reviewed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of these , 20 cases met the US Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control criteria for the diagnosis of Reye syndrome .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Aspirin or salicylate ingestion had occurred in only one of the 20 cases ( 5 % ) , and paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) had been administered in only six of
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O
the cases ( 30 % ) .
O O O O O O O
Pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis of Reye syndrome was accomplished in 90 % of the cases .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The incidence of Reye syndrome in New South Wales , Australia , is estimated from this study to be approximately nine cases per 1 million children compared with recent US
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
data of ten to 20 cases per 1 million children and three to seven cases per 1 million children in Great Britain .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mortality for these Reye syndrome cases in Australia was 45 % as compared with a 32 % case - fatality rate in the United States .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In Australia , the pediatric usage of aspirin has been extremely low for the past 25 years ( less than 1 % of total dosage units sold ) , with
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) dominating the pediatric analgesic and antipyretic market .
B O B O O O O O O O O O
Reye syndrome may be disappearing from Australia despite a total lack of association with salicylates or aspirin ingestion , since there were no cases found at The Children 's Hospital
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in 1983 , 1984 , or 1985 .

Beta - 2 - adrenoceptor - mediated hypokalemia and its abolishment by oxprenolol .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The time course and concentration - effect relationship of terbutaline - induced hypokalemia was studied , using computer - aided pharmacokinetic - dynamic modeling .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Subsequently we investigated the efficacy of oxprenolol in antagonizing such hypokalemia , together with the pharmacokinetic interaction between both drugs .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Six healthy subjects were given a 0 . 5 mg subcutaneous dose of terbutaline on two occasions : 1 hour after oral administration of a placebo and 1 hour after
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
80 mg oxprenolol orally .
O O B O O
In the 7 - hour period after terbutaline administration , plasma samples were taken for determination of plasma potassium levels and drug concentrations .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
The sigmoid Emax model offered a good description of the relation between terbutaline concentrations and potassium effects .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O
Oxprenolol caused decreases of 65 % and 56 % of terbutaline volume of distribution and clearance , respectively , and an increase of 130 % of its AUC .
B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In spite of higher terbutaline concentrations after oxprenolol pretreatment , the hypokalemia was almost completely antagonized by the beta 2 - blocking action .

Midline B3 serotonin nerves in rat medulla are involved in hypotensive effect of methyldopa .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O
Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of methyldopa onto the ventrolateral cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla elicits a hypotensive response mediated by a
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
projection descending into the spinal cord .
O O O O O O O
The present experiments were designed to investigate the role of the midline cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla , coinciding with the raphe magnus .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
In spontaneously hypertensive , stroke - prone rats , microinjection of methyldopa into the area of the midline B3 serotonin cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent hypotension
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
of 30 - 40 mm Hg , which was maximal 2 - 3 h after administration and was abolished by the serotonin neurotoxin 5 , 7 - dihydroxytryptamine (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I I I O
5 , 7 - DHT ) injected intracerebroventricularly .
B I I I I O O O O
However , intraspinal injection of 5 , 7 - DHT to produce a more selective lesion of only descending serotonin projections in the spinal cord did not affect this hypotension
O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Further , 5 , 7 - DHT lesion of serotonin nerves travelling in the median forebrain bundle , one of the main ascending pathways from the B3 serotonin cells ,
O O B I I I I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
did not affect the fall in blood pressure associated with a midline B3 serotonin methyldopa injection .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B B O O
It is concluded therefore that , unlike the ventrolateral B3 cells which mediate a methyldopa - induced hypotension via descending projections , the midline serotonin B3 cells in the medulla
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
contribute to the hypotensive action of methyldopa , either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle , or through a projection restricted
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to the caudal brainstem .

Yohimbine treatment of sexual side effects induced by serotonin reuptake blockers .
B O O O O O O O B O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that yohimbine facilitates sexual behavior and may be helpful in the treatment of male impotence .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A single case report suggests that yohimbine may be used to treat the sexual side effects of clomipramine .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O
This study evaluated yohimbine as a treatment for the sexual side effects caused by serotonin reuptake blockers .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
METHOD :
O O
Six patients with either obsessive compulsive disorder , trichotillomania , anxiety , or affective disorders who suffered sexual side effects after treatment with serotonin reuptake blockers were given yohimbine on
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O
a p . r . n . basis in an open clinical trial .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Various doses of yohimbine were used to determine the ideal dose for each patient .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Five of the six patients experienced improved sexual functioning after taking yohimbine .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O
One patient who failed to comply with yohimbine treatment had no therapeutic effects .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Side effects of yohimbine included excessive sweating , increased anxiety , and a wound - up feeling in some patients .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
The results of this study indicate that yohimbine may be an effective treatment for the sexual side effects caused by serotonin reuptake blockers .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Future controlled studies are needed to further investigate the effectiveness and safety of yohimbine for this indication .

Reversible myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus in a pediatric heart transplant recipient : case report .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressant that is frequently used in organ transplantation .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , adverse effects include cardiac toxicity .
O O O O O O O O
Herein we describe transient myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus after heart transplantation .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The hypertrophy caused no clinical symptoms but was noted because of elevation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration and confirmed at echocardiography .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Initially , allograft rejection was feared ; however , myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial edema and mild myocardial hypertrophy ; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The blood tacrolimus concentration was higher than usual at that time ; thus , tacrolimus dosage was reduced .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of tacrolimus and did not recur , as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , we conclude that tacrolimus induces reversible myocardial hypertrophy .
O O O O O B O O O O O
In patients receiving tacrolimus therapy , blood concentration should be carefully controlled and extreme attention paid to cardiac involvement .

A prospective , randomized , double - blind pilot study to compare the results of stereotactic unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy in advanced idiopathic Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) refractory
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to medical treatment was designed .
O O O O O O
Ten consecutive patients ( mean age , 58 . 4 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
6 . 8 years ; 7 men , 3 women ) with similar characteristics at the duration of disease ( mean disease time , 8 . 4 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 . 5 years ) , disabling motor fluctuations ( Hoehn _ Yahr stage 3 - 5 in off - drug phases ) and levodopa - induced dyskinesias were selected
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
.
O
All patients had bilateral symptoms and their levodopa equivalent dosing were analysed .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Six patients were operated on in the globus pallidus interna ( GPi ) and four in the subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical evaluation included the use of the Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) , Hoehn_Yahr score and Schwab England activities of daily living ( ADL ) score
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in ' on' - and ' off' - drug conditions before surgery and 6 months after surgery .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was statistically significant improvement in all contralateral major parkinsonian motor signs in all patients followed for 6 months .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Levodopa equivalent daily intake was significantly reduced in the STN group .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
Changes in UPDRS , Hoehn _ Yahr and Schwab England ADL scores were similar in both groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cognitive functions were unchanged in both groups .
O O O O O O O O
Complications were observed in two patients : one had a left homonymous hemianopsia after pallidotomy and another one developed left hemiballistic movements 3 days after subthalamotomy which partly improved within
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 month with Valproate 1000 mg / day .
O O O B O O O O O
The findings of this study suggest that lesions of the unilateral STN and GPi are equally effective treatment for patients with advanced PD refractory to medical treatment .

Protective effects of antithrombin on puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis in rats .
O O O O O B I O O O O
We investigated the effects of antithrombin , a plasma inhibitor of coagulation factors , in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrosis , which is an experimental model of human
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
nephrotic syndrome .
O O O
Antithrombin ( 50 or 500 IU / kg / i . v . ) was administered to rats once a day for 10 days immediately after the injection of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
puromycin aminonucleoside ( 50 mg / kg / i . v . ) .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
Treatment with antithrombin attenuated the puromycin aminonucleoside - induced hematological abnormalities .
O O O O O B I O O O O O
Puromycin aminonucleoside - induced renal dysfunction and hyperlipidemia were also suppressed .
B I O O O O O O O O O O
Histopathological examination revealed severe renal damage such as proteinaceous casts in tubuli and tubular expansion in the kidney of control rats , while an improvement of the damage was seen
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in antithrombin - treated rats .
O O O O O O
In addition , antithrombin treatment markedly suppressed puromycin aminonucleoside - induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells .
O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , puromycin aminonucleoside - induced increases in renal cytokine content were also decreased .
O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings suggest that thrombin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrotic syndrome .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
Treatment with antithrombin may be clinically effective in patients with nephrotic syndrome .

Reverse or inverted left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome ( reverse Takotsubo cardiomyopathy ) in a young woman in the setting of amphetamine use .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome was first described in Japan as """" Takotsubo cardiomyopathy . """"
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This syndrome has been identified in many other countries .
O O O O O O O O O O
Many variations of this syndrome have been recently described in the literature .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One of the rarest is the reverse type of this syndrome , with hyperdynamic apex and complete akinesia of the base ( as opposed to the classic apical ballooning )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.

Attenuated disruption of prepulse inhibition by dopaminergic stimulation after maternal deprivation and adolescent corticosterone treatment in rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The development of schizophrenia may include an early neurodevelopmental stress component which increases vulnerability to later stressful life events , in combination leading to overt disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We investigated the effect of an early stress , in the form of maternal deprivation , combined with a later stress , simulated by chronic periadolescent corticosterone treatment , on
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
behaviour in rats .
O O O O
Acute treatment with apomorphine caused disruption of prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) in controls and in rats that had undergone either maternal deprivation or corticosterone treatment , but was surprisingly
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
absent in rats that had undergone the combined early and late stress .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Amphetamine treatment significantly disrupted PPI in both non - deprived groups , but was absent in both maternally deprived groups .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The serotonin - 1A receptor agonist , 8 - OH - DPAT , induced a significant disruption of PPI in all groups .
O B O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
Amphetamine - induced locomotor hyperactivity was similar in all groups .
B O O O O O O O O O O
These results show an inhibitory interaction of early stress , caused by maternal deprivation , combined with ' adolescent ' stress , simulated by corticosterone treatment , on dopaminergic regulation
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
of PPI .
O O O
The altered effects of apomorphine and amphetamine could indicate differential changes in dopamine receptor signalling leading to functional desensitisation , or altered modulation of sensory gating in the nucleus accumbens

by limbic structures such as the hippocampus .

Peripheral iron dextran induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in rat substantia nigra .
O B I O O O O O O O O O O
Iron accumulation is considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson 's disease .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To demonstrate the relationship between peripheral iron overload and dopaminergic neuron loss in rat substantia nigra ( SN ) , in the present study we used fast cyclic voltammetry ,
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) immunohistochemistry , Perls ' iron staining , and high performance liquid chromatography - electrochemical detection to study the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and increased
B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
iron content in the SN of iron dextran overloaded animals .
B O O O O O B I O O O
The findings showed that peripheral iron dextran overload increased the iron staining positive cells and reduced the number of TH - immunoreactive neurons in the SN .
O O O O O B I O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As a result , dopamine release and content , as well as its metabolites contents were decreased in caudate putamen .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Even more dramatic changes were found in chronic overload group .
O O O O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that peripheral iron dextran can increase the iron level in the SN , where excessive iron causes the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons .
O O O O O B I O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The chronic iron overload may be more destructive to dopaminergic neurons than the acute iron overload .

Skin reactions associated with oral coumarin - derived anticoagulants are an uncommon occurrence .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Leukocytoclastic vasculitis ( LV ) is primarily a cutaneous small vessel vasculitis , though systemic involvement may be encountered .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We report 4 patients with late - onset LV probably due to warfarin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
All 4 patients presented with skin eruptions that developed after receiving warfarin for several years .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The results of skin lesion biopsies were available in 3 patients , confirming LV Cutaneous lesions resolved in all patients after warfarin was discontinued .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
In 2 of the 4 patients , rechallenge with warfarin led to recurrence of the lesions .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
LV may be a late - onset adverse reaction associated with warfarin therapy .

cord ischemia .
O O O
We investigated the relationship between the degeneration of spinal motor neurons and activation of N - methyl - d - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors after neuraxial morphine following a
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O B O O O O B O O
noninjurious interval of aortic occlusion in rats .
O O O O O O O O
Spinal cord ischemia was induced by aortic occlusion for 6 min with a balloon catheter .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In a microdialysis study , 10 muL of saline ( group C ; n = 8 ) or 30 mug of morphine ( group M ; n = 8 )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
was injected intrathecally ( IT ) 0 . 5 h after reflow , and 30 mug of morphine ( group SM ; n = 8 ) or 10 muL of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
saline ( group SC ; n = 8 ) was injected IT 0 . 5 h after sham operation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Microdialysis samples were collected preischemia , before IT injection , and at 2 , 4 , 8 , 24 , and 48 h of reperfusion ( after IT injection )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Second , we investigated the effect of IT MK - 801 ( 30 mug ) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after morphine - induced spastic paraparesis .
O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
After IT morphine , the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) glutamate concentration was increased in group M relative to both baseline and group C ( P < 0 . 05
O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) .
O O
This increase persisted for 8 hrs .
O O O O O O O
IT MK - 801 significantly reduced the number of dark - stained alpha - motoneurons after morphine - induced spastic paraparesis compared with the saline group .
O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
These data indicate that IT morphine induces spastic paraparesis with a concomitant increase in CSF glutamate , which is involved in NMDA receptor activation .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O
We suggest that opioids may be neurotoxic in the setting of spinal cord ischemia via NMDA receptor activation .

Sodium channel beta - subunits modulate channel gating , assembly , and cell surface expression in heterologous cell systems .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We generated beta2 ( - / - ) mice to investigate the role of beta2 in control of sodium channel density , localization , and function in neurons in vivo
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O

O O O O
The loss of beta2 resulted in negative shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation as well as significant decreases in sodium current density in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
The integral of the compound action potential in optic nerve was significantly reduced , and the threshold for action potential generation was increased , indicating a reduction in the level

Screening for stimulant use in adult emergency department seizure patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive plasma drug screening for cocaine or amphetamine in adult emergency department seizure patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
This prospective study evaluated consecutive eligible seizure patients who had a plasma sample collected as part of their clinical evaluation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Plasma was tested for amphetamine and the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine using enzyme - mediated immunoassay methodology .
O O O O B O O B O B O O O O O O O
Plasma samples with benzoylecgonine greater than 150 ng / mL or an amphetamine greater than 500 ng / mL were defined as positive .
O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Patient demographics , history of underlying drug or alcohol - related seizure disorder , estimated time from seizure to sample collection , history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse , and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Fourteen of 248 ( 5 . 6 % , 95 % CI 2 . 7 % - 8 . 5 % ) plasma samples were positive by immunoassay testing for
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
benzoylecgonine and no samples ( 0 % , 95 % CI 0 - 1 . 2 % ) were positive for amphetamine .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Positive test results were more common in patient visits where there was a history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse ( p < 0 . 0005 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
During this study period , routine plasma screening for cocaine and amphetamines in adult seizure patients had a low yield .
O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O
As a result , routine plasma screening would yield few cases of stimulant drug in which there was neither a history nor suspicion of drug abuse in this population .

Evidence of functional somatotopy in GPi from results of pallidotomy .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The objective of this study was to explore the functional anatomy of the globus pallidus internus ( GPi ) by studying the effects of unilateral pallidotomy on parkinsonian ' off
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
' signs and levodopa - induced dyskinesias ( LID ) .
O O O B O O O O O O O
We found significant positive correlations between the preoperative levodopa responsiveness of motor signs and the levodopa responsiveness of scores in timed tests ( Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations )
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the contralateral limbs and the improvement in these scores after surgery , whereas there was no correlation with the improvement in LID .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We also found a highly significant correlation ( P : < 0 . 0001 , r = 0 . 8 ) between the volume of the ventral lesion in the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
GPi and the improvement in LID in the contralateral limbs , whereas there was no correlation between the ventral volume and the improvement in parkinsonian ' off ' signs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The volumes of the total lesion cylinder and the dorsal lesion did not correlate with the outcome of either dyskinesias or parkinsonian ' off ' signs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The differential predictive value of levodopa responsiveness for the outcome of parkinsonian ' off ' signs and LID and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with dyskinesias and parkinsonian
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
' off ' signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of parkinsonian ' off ' signs and dyskinesias .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Whereas cells in a wider area of the GPi may be implicated in parkinsonism , the ventral GPi seems to be crucial for the manifestation of LID .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We suggest that our observations are additional proof of the functional somatotopy of the systems within the GPi that mediate parkinsonism and dyskinesias , especially along the dorsoventral trajectory used
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in pallidotomy .
O O O
The outcome of pallidotomy in which the lesion involves the ventral and dorsal GPi could be the net effect of alteration in the activity of pathways which mediate different symptoms
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, and hence could be variable .

Pain responses in methadone - maintained opioid abusers .
O O O B O O O O O
Providing pain management for known opioid abusers is a challenging clinical task , in part because little is known about their pain experience and analgesic requirements .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This study was designed to describe pain tolerance and analgesic response in a sample of opioid addicts stabilized in methadone - maintenance ( MM ) treatment ( n = 60
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
) in comparison to matched nondependent control subjects ( n = 60 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
By using a placebo - controlled , two - way factorial design , tolerance to cold - pressor ( CP ) pain was examined , both before and after oral
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
administration of therapeutic doses of common opioid ( hydromorphone 2 mg ) and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory ( ketorolac 10 mg ) analgesic agents .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Results showed that MM individuals were significantly less tolerant of CP pain than control subjects , replicating previous work .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Analgesic effects were significant neither for medication nor group .
O O O O O O O O O O
These data indicate that MM opioid abusers represent a pain - intolerant subset of clinical patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their complaints of pain should be evaluated seriously and managed aggressively .

Urine N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase - - a marker of tubular damage ?
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Although an indicator of renal tubular dysfunction , an increased urinary N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase ( NAG ) activity might reflect increased lysosomal activity in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
renal tubular cells .
O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ) was administered to Sprague Dawley rats to induce proteinuria .
B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Total protein , albumin , NAG activity and protein electrophoretic pattern were assessed in daily urine samples for 33 days .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The morphological appearance of the kidneys was examined on days three , four , six , eight and thirty three and the NAG isoenzyme patterns on days zero , four
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, eight and thirty three .
O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Following intravenous PAN urine volume and urine NAG activity increased significantly by day two , but returned to normal by day four .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After day four all treated animals exhibited a marked rise in urine albumin , total protein excretion and NAG activity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Electrophoresis showed a generalised increase in middle and high molecular weight urine proteins from day four onwards .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Protein droplets first appeared prominent in tubular cells on day four .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Peak urine NAG activity and a change in NAG isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak proteinuria and the reduction in intracellular protein and NAG droplets ( day six onwards
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) .
O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
This animal model demonstrates that an increase in lysosomal turnover and hence urine NAG activity , occurs when increased protein is presented to the tubular cells .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Urine NAG activity is thus a measure of altered function in the renal tubules and not simply an indicator of damage .

Over expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor during the development of estrogen - induced rat pituitary tumors may mediate estrogen - initiated tumor angiogenesis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Estrogens , which have been associated with several types of human and animal cancers , can induce tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of Fischer 344 rats .

The results demonstrated that 17beta - estradiol ( E2 ) induces neovascularization , as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure .

The high tumor angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated VEGF / VPF protein expression in the E2 exposed pituitary of ovariectomized ( OVEX ) rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
VEGF / VPF and FVIIIRAg immunohistochemistry and endothelial specific lectin ( UEA1 ) binding studies , indicate that the elevation of VEGF protein expression initially occurred in both blood vessels
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and non - endothelial cells .
O O O O O O
After 15 days of E2 exposure , VEGF / VPF protein expression , in the non - endothelial cell population , sharply declined and was restricted to the blood vessels

The function of non - endothelial - derived VEGF is not clear .

Furthermore , immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that VEGFR - 2 ( flk - 1 / KDR ) , expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7

Dose - effect and structure - function relationships in doxorubicin cardiomyopathy .
O O O O O O O O O B O O
The cardiomyopathy ( CM ) produced by the anticancer drug doxorubicin ( DXR ) ( Adriamycin ) provides a unique opportunity to analyze dose - effect and structure - function
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
relationships during development of myocardial disease .
O O O O O O O
We measured the degree of morphologic damage by ultrastructural examination of endomyocardial biopsy and the degree of performance abnormally by right heart catheterization in patients receiving DXR .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Morphologic damage was variable but was proportional to the total cumulative DXR dose between 100 and 600 mg / m2 .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Performance abnormalities correlated weakly with dose , exhibited a curvilinear relationship , and had a """" threshold """" for expression .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Catheterization abnormalities correlated well with morphologic damage ( r = 0 . 57 to 0 . 78 ) in a subgroup of patients in whom exercise hemodynamics were measured ,

and this relationship also exhibited a curvilinear , threshold configuration .
O O O O O O O O O O O
In DXR - CM myocardial damage is proportional to the degree of cytotoxic insult ( DXR dose ) while myocardial function is preserved until a critical dose or degree of

Experimental cyclosporine nephrotoxicity : risk of concomitant chemotherapy .
O B O O O O O O O
The role of cyclosporine ( CSA ) alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutics in the development of renal toxicity was evaluated in rats .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Administration of 20 mg / kg / day CSA for 4 weeks caused renal functional and structural changes similar to those reported in man .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The combined administration of CSA and various chemotherapeutic drugs with a nephrotoxic potential , such as gentamicin ( at therapeutic doses ) , amphothericin B and ketoconazole , which are
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I O B O O O
frequently used in immunosuppressed patients , did not aggravate the CSA induced toxicity in the rat model .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O

Receptor mechanisms of nicotine - induced locomotor hyperactivity in chronic nicotine - treated rats .
O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O
Rats were pretreated with saline or nicotine ( 1 . 5 mg / kg per day ) by subcutaneously implanting each animal with an Alzet osmotic mini - pump which
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
continuously released saline or nicotine for 1 , 5 and 14 days .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O
At the end of each pretreatment period , animals were used for ( i ) determining their locomotor response to acutely injected nicotine ( 0 . 2 mg / kg
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
, s . c . ) and ( ii ) measuring the density of L - [ 3H ] nicotine and [ 3H ] spiperone binding sites in the striatum
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O
.
O
We observed no changes in nicotine - induced locomotor response , striatal L - [ 3H ] nicotine and [ 3H ] spiperone binding in the animals pretreated with
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O
nicotine for 1 day .
B O O O O
In rats which were pretreated with nicotine for 5 days , there was a significant increase in the nicotine - stimulated locomotor response which was associated with an increase in
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
the number of L - [ 3H ] nicotine binding sites and also with an elevated dopamine ( DA ) level in the striatum .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O
The number of striatal [ 3H ] spiperone binding sites was not affected .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
In animals pretreated with nicotine for 14 days , the nicotine - induced locomotor response remained to be potentiated .
O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
However , this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [ 3H ] spiperone binding sites , whereas the number of striatal L - [ 3H ]
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nicotine binding sites and the striatal DA level were normal .
B O O O O O B O O O O
These results suggest that chronic nicotine - treated rats develop locomotor hyperactivity in response to nicotine initially due to increases of both the density of nicotinic receptors and DA concentration
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
, followed by inducing DA receptor supersensitivity in the striatum .

Oral hydrocortisone increases blood pressure and enhances pressor responsiveness in normal human subjects .

Resting forearm vascular resistance remained unchanged , but the reflex response to the cold pressor test was accentuated , the rise in resistance increasing from 10 . 5 mm Hg

A shift to the left in the dose - response relation and fall in threshold suggested increased sensitivity to norepinephrine after treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Measurement of resting norepinephrine spillover rate to plasma and norepinephrine uptake indicated that overall resting sympathetic nervous system activity was not increased .

Effects of suprofen on the isolated perfused rat kidney .
O O B O O O O O O O
Although suprofen has been associated with the development of acute renal failure in greater than 100 subjects , the mechanism of damage remains unclear .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The direct nephrotoxic effects of a single dose of 15 mg of suprofen were compared in the recirculating isolated rat kidney perfused with cell - free buffer with or without
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the addition of 5 mg / dL of uric acid .
O O O O O O O O B I O
There were no significant differences in renal sodium excretion , oxygen consumption , or urinary flow rates in kidneys perfused with suprofen compared with the drug - free control groups
O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
.
O
In contrast , a significant decline in glomerular filtration rate was found after the introduction of suprofen to the kidney perfused with uric acid ; no changes were found with
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I O O O O O O
suprofen in the absence of uric acid .
B O O O O B I O
A significant decrease in the baseline excretion rate of uric acid was found in rats given suprofen , compared with drug - free controls .
O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
However , the fractional excretion of uric acid was unchanged between the groups over the experimental period .
O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
In summary , suprofen causes acute declines in renal function , most likely by directly altering the intrarenal distribution of uric acid .

Cocaine - induced brainstem seizures and behavior .
B O O O O O O O
A variety of abnormal sensory / motor behaviors associated with electrical discharges recorded from the bilateral brainstem were induced in adult WKY rats by mechanical ( electrode implants ) and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DC electrical current stimulations and by acute and chronic administration of cocaine .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The electrode implant implicated one side or the other of the reticular system of the brainstem but subjects were not incapacitated by the stimulations .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cocaine ( 40 mg / kg ) was injected subcutaneously for an acute experiment and subsequent 20 mg / kg doses twice daily for 3 days in a chronic study
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Cocaine generated more abnormal behaviors in the brainstem perturbation group , especially the electrically perturbated subjects .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The abnormal behaviors were yawning , retrocollis , hyperactivity , hypersensitivity , """" beating drum """" behavior , squealing , head bobbing , circling , sniffing , abnormal posturing ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and facial twitching .
O O O O
Shifts in the power frequency spectra of the discharge patterns were noted between quiet and pacing behavioral states .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hypersensitivity to various auditory , tactile , and visual stimulation was present and shifts in the brainstem ambient power spectral frequency occurred in response to tactile stimulation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings suggest that the brainstem generates and propagates pathological discharges that can be elicited by mechanical and DC electrical perturbation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cocaine was found to activate the discharge system and thus induce abnormal behaviors that are generated at the discharge site and at distant sites to which the discharge propagates .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cognitive functions may also be involved since dopaminergic and serotonergic cellular elements at the brainstem level are also implicated .

Increased sulfation and decreased 7alpha - hydroxylation of deoxycholic acid in ethinyl estradiol - induced cholestasis in rats .
O O O O O O O O B I O B I O O O O O O
Deoxycholic acid conjugation , transport capacity , and metabolism were compared in control and ethinyl estradiol - treated rats .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
Control rats were found to have a lower capacity to transport deoxycholic acid than taurodeoxycholic acid , and both were decreased by ethinyl estradiol treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I O O O O O O B I O O
During [ 24 - 14C ] sodium deoxycholate infusion , [ 14C ] biliary bile acid secretion increased , but bile flow did not change significantly in either control or
O O O O O O B I O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ethinyl estradiol - treated rats .
B I O O O O
Ethinyl estradiol - treated animals excreted significantly less 14C as taurocholic acid than did control animals , consistent with an impairment of 7alpha - hydroxylation of taurodeoxycholic acid .
B I O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Ethinyl estradiol treatment did not impair conjugation of deoxycholic acid , but did result in an increase in sulfation of taurodeoxycholic acid from 1 . 5 % in controls to
B I O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
nearly 4 . 0 % ( P less than 0 . 01 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rat has a poorer tolerance for deoxycholic acid than do certain other species .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
Furthermore , the rat converts deoxycholic acid , a poor choleretic , to taurocholic acid , a good choleretic .
O O O O O B I O O O O O O B I O O O O O
When this conversion is impaired with ethinyl estradiol treatment , sulfation may be an important alternate pathway for excretion of this potentially harmful bile acid .

Effects of ouabain on myocardial oxygen supply and demand in patients with chronic coronary artery disease .

A hemodynamic , volumetric , and metabolic study in patients without heart failure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The effects of digitalis glycosides on myocardial oxygen supply and demand are of particular interest in the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease , but have not been measured previously
O O O B I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in man .
O O O
We assessed the effects of ouabain ( 0 . 015 mg / kg body weight ) on hemodynamic , volumetric , and metabolic parameters in 11 patients with severe chronic
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
coronary artery disease without clinical congestive heart failure .
O O O O O O O O O
Because the protocol was long and involved interventions which might affect the determinations , we also studied in nine patients using an identical protocol except that ouabain administration was omitted
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
.
O
Left ventricular end - diastolic pressure and left ventricular end - diastolic volume fell in each patient given ouabain , even though they were initially elevated in only two patients
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Left ventricular end - diastolic pressure fell from 11 . 5 + / - 1 . 4 ( mean + / - SE ) to 5 . 6 + /
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- 0 . 9 mm Hg ( P less than 0 . 001 ) and left ventricular end - diastolic volume fell from 100 + / - 17 to 82
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The maximum velocity of contractile element shortening increased from 1 . 68 + / - 0 . 11 ml / s to 2 . 18 + / - 0 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
21 muscle - lengths / s ( P less than 0 . 05 ) and is consistent with an increase in contractility .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No significant change in these parameters occurred in the control patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
No significant change in myocardial oxygen consumption occurred after ouabain administration but this may be related to a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure in the ouabain patients than in
O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
the control patients .
O O O O
We conclude that in patients with chronic coronary artery disease who are not in clinical congestive heart failure left ventricular end - diastolic volume falls after ouabain administration even when
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
it is initially normal .
O O O O O
Though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension , and , therefore , of myocardial oxygen consumption , it may not be of sufficient magnitude to
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
prevent a net increase in myocardial oxygen consumption .
O O O O O O B O O
Nevertheless , compensatory mechanisms prevent a deterioration of resting myocardial metabolism .

Prolongation of the QT interval related to cisapride - diltiazem interaction .
O O O O O O O B O B O O
Cisapride , a cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) substrate , is widely prescribed for the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Prolongation of QT interval , torsades de pointes , and sudden cardiac death have been reported after concomitant administration with erythromycin or azole antifungal agents , but not with other
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O
CYP3A4 inhibitors .
O O O
A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45 - year - old woman who was taking cisapride for gastroesophageal reflux disorder and diltiazem , an agent that has inhibitory effect
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O
on CYP3A4 , for hypertension .

We recorded indication for conversion , whether conversion was early or late after transplantation , tacrolimus dose and trough blood level at conversion , and incidence of rejection after conversion
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.

Conversion was early in 29 patients ( 41 . 4 % ) and late in 41 ( 58 . 6 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Indications for early conversion were neurotoxicity ( 20 ) , ( insulin - dependent ) diabetes mellitus ( IDDM ) ( 5 ) , nephrotoxicity ( 3 ) , gastrointestinal
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( GI ) toxicity ( 6 ) , and cardiomyopathy ( 1 ) , and for late conversion were neurotoxicity ( 15 ) , IDDM ( 12 ) , nephrotoxicity
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( 3 ) , GI toxicity ( 5 ) , hepatotoxicity ( 6 ) , post - transplant lmphoproliferate disease ( PTLD ) ( 2 ) , cardiomyopathy ( 1
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All early - conversion patients showed improvement / resolution of symptoms .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Among late - conversion patients , 37 ( 90 . 2 % ) had improvement / resolution ; in 4 ( 9 . 8 % ) , adverse effects persisted

Relative efficacy and toxicity of netilmicin and tobramycin in oncology patients .
O O O O O B O B O O O O
We prospectively compared the efficacy and safety of netilmicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate in conjunction with piperacillin sodium in 118 immunocompromised patients with presumed severe infections .
O O O O O O O O B I O B I O O O B I O O O O O O O O O
The two treatment regimens were equally efficacious .
O O O O O O O O
Nephrotoxicity occurred in a similar proportion in patients treated with netilmicin and tobramycin ( 17 % vs 11 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O
Ototoxicity occurred in four ( 9 . 5 % ) of 42 netilmicin and piperacillin and in 12 ( 22 % ) of 54 tobramycin and piperacillin - treated patients
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O
.

Of those evaluated with posttherapy audiograms , three of four netilmicin and piperacillin - treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine tobramycin and
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
piperacillin - treated patients .
B O O O O
The number of greater than or equal to 15 - dB increases in auditory threshold as a proportion of total greater than or equal to 15 - dB changes (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
increases and decreases ) was significantly lower in netilmicin and piperacillin - vs tobramycin and piperacillin - treated patients ( 18 of 78 vs 67 of 115 ) .
O O O O O O O O B O B O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We conclude that aminoglycoside - associated ototoxicity was less severe and more often reversible with netilmicin than with tobramycin .

Effect of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors on experimentally induced convulsions in rats .
O O B O O O O O O O O O
To investigate the relationship of prostaglandins ( PGs ) to seizure induction , the effects of six PG synthetase inhibitors on convulsions induced by flurothyl , picrotoxin , pentetrazol (
O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O
PTZ ) , electroshock or bicuculline were evaluated .
B O O O O B O O O
Ibuprofen , sulindac , mefenamic acid , and low dose meclofenamic acid increased the latency - to - onset in the flurothyl and / or PTZ models ; the electroshock

, picrotoxin and bicuculline models were not significantly affected by any of the pretreatment agents .
O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that PGs are involved in the mechanism ( s ) underlying fluorthyl - and PTZ - induced convulsions , but not picrotoxin - , electroshock - ,

This is a case report on a 45 - year old African - American female with newly diagnosed hypertension , who was started on a combination pill of amlodipine /
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
benazapril 10 / 5 mg .
B O O O O O
The very next day , she presented at the emergency room ( ER ) with abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Physical exam , complete metabolic panel , and hemogram were in the normal range .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She was discharged from the ER after a few hours of treatment with fluid and analgesics .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , she returned to the ER the next day with the same complaints .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This time the physical exam was significant for a distended abdomen with dullness to percussion .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CT scan of the abdomen revealed markedly thickened antrum of the stomach , duodenum and jejunum , along with fluid in the abdominal and pelvic cavity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) - induced angioedema was suspected , and anti - hypertensive medications were discontinued .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Her symptoms improved within the next 24 hours , and repeat CT after 72 hours revealed marked improvement in stomach and small bowel thickening and resolution of ascites .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Valproic acid
B I
I : time course of lipid peroxidation biomarkers , liver toxicity , and valproic acid metabolite levels in rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
A single dose of valproic acid ( VPA ) , which is a widely used antiepileptic drug , is associated with oxidative stress in rats , as recently demonstrated by
O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
elevated levels of 15 - F ( 2t ) - isoprostane ( 15 - F ( 2t ) - IsoP ) .
O O O B I I I I I I I O B I I I I I I I O O
To determine whether there was a temporal relationship between VPA - associated oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity , adult male Sprague - Dawley rats were treated ip with VPA ( 500
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
mg / kg ) or 0 . 9 % saline ( vehicle ) once daily for 2 , 4 , 7 , 10 , or 14 days .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Oxidative stress was assessed by determining plasma and liver levels of 15 - F ( 2t ) - IsoP , lipid hydroperoxides ( LPO ) , and
O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O B I O B O O O
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( TBARs ) .
B I I I O B O O
Plasma and liver 15 - F ( 2t ) - IsoP were elevated and reached a plateau after day 2 of VPA treatment compared to control .
O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Liver LPO levels were not elevated until day 7 of treatment ( 1 . 8 - fold versus control , p < 0 . 05 ) .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Liver and plasma TBARs were not increased until 14 days ( 2 - fold vs . control , p < 0 . 05 ) .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Liver toxicity was evaluated based on serum levels of alpha - glutathione S - transferase ( alpha - GST ) and by histology .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Serum alpha - GST levels were significantly elevated by day 4 , which corresponded to hepatotoxicity as shown by the increasing incidence of inflammation of the liver capsule , necrosis
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, and steatosis throughout the study .
O O O O O O O
The liver levels of beta - oxidation metabolites of VPA were decreased by day 14 , while the levels of 4 - ene - VPA and ( E ) -
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O
2 , 4 - diene - VPA were not elevated throughout the study .
B I I I I I I O O O O O O O
Overall , these findings indicate that VPA treatment results in oxidative stress , as measured by levels of 15 - F ( 2t ) - IsoP , which precedes the
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O
onset of necrosis , steatosis , and elevated levels of serum alpha - GST .

Pheochromocytoma unmasked by amisulpride and tiapride .
O O O B O B O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To describe the unmasking of pheochromocytoma in a patient treated with amisulpride and tiapride .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
CASE SUMMARY :
O O O
A 42 - year - old white man developed acute hypertension with severe headache and vomiting 2 hours after the first doses of amisulpride 100 mg and tiapride 100 mg
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O
.
O
Both drugs were immediately discontinued , and the patient recovered after subsequent nicardipine and verapamil treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O
Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass , and postoperative histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DISCUSSION :
O O
Drug - induced symptoms of pheochromocytoma are often associated with the use of substituted benzamide drugs , but the underlying mechanism is unknown .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
In our case , use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible relationship between the hypertensive crisis and amisulpride and tiapride therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
As of March 24 , 2005 , this is the first reported case of amisulpride - and tiapride - induced hypertensive crisis in a patient with pheochromocytoma .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Physicians and other healthcare professionals should be aware of this potential adverse effect of tiapride and amisulpride .

Quantitative drug levels in stimulant psychosis : relationship to symptom severity , catecholamines and hyperkinesia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
To examine the relationship between quantitative stimulant drug levels , catecholamines , and psychotic symptoms , nineteen patients in a psychiatric emergency service with a diagnosis of amphetamine - or
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
cocaine - induced psychosis were interviewed , and plasma and urine were collected for quantitative assays of stimulant drug and catecholamine metabolite levels .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Methamphetamine or amphetamine levels were related to several psychopathology scores and the global hyperkinesia rating .
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HVA levels were related to global hyperkinesia but not to psychopathology ratings .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although many other factors such as sensitization may play a role , intensity of stimulant - induced psychotic symptoms and stereotypies appears to be at least in part dose -

Delayed asystolic cardiac arrest after diltiazem overdose ; resuscitation with high dose intravenous calcium .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O
A 51 year old man took a mixed overdose including 1 . 8 - 3 . 6 g of diltiazem , paracetamol , aspirin , isosorbide nitrate , and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O B B O O
alcohol .
B O
He initially presented to hospital after six hours with mild hypotension and was treated with activated charcoal and intravenous fluids .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Eighteen hours after the overdose he had two generalised tonic - clonic seizures .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient remained unresponsive with junctional bradycardia , unrecordable blood pressure , and then became asystolic .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was resuscitated with high dose ( 13 . 5 g ) intravenous calcium and adrenaline ( epinephrine ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O
He required inotropic support and temporary pacing over the next 48 hours .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This case suggests there is a role for aggressive high dose intravenous calcium therapy in severe diltiazem overdose , particularly with the onset of asystole .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O
It should be considered early in cases of cardiac arrest after diltiazem overdose .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
The case also highlights the problems with delayed toxicity when whole bowel irrigation is not administered .

Renal papillary necrosis due to naproxen .
O O O O O B O
A 31 - year - old man with rheumatoid arthritis , who had previously been treated with sulindac , fenoprofen calcium , high dose salicylates and gold salts , developed
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I O O O B O B O O O
renal papillary necrosis ( RPN ) 4 months after institution of naproxen therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
No other factor predisposing to RPN could be discovered .
O O O O O O O O O O
Sulindac was substituted for naproxen and no further adverse renal effects occurred over the next 12 months .
B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We review previous reports linking RPN to antiinflammatory drug use and discuss possible advantages of sulindac in patients who have experienced renal toxicity from other antiinflammatory agents .

Adverse interaction between beta - adrenergic blocking drugs and verapamil - - report of three cases .
O O O B I I I I O B O O O O O O O
Three patients with ischaemic heart disease developed profound cardiac failure , hypotension and bradycardia during combined therapy with verapamil and beta - adrenergic blocking drugs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I I I O
This clinical picture resolved completely with cessation of the combined therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Baseline left ventricular function , assessed by cardiac catheterisation or nuclear angiography , was normal in two patients and only mildly reduced in the other .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Simultaneously administration of beta - adrenergic blocking drugs and verapamil may result in profound adverse interactions and should only be administered with great caution .

Report of Medical Research Council Working Party on Mild to Moderate Hypertension .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Participants in the Medical Research Council treatment trial for mild hypertension are randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups : bendrofluazide , propranolol , or a placebo for either
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O
of these drugs .
O O O O
The trial is single - blind .
O O O O O O O
23 582 patient - years of observation have been completed so far , 10 684 on active drugs and 12 898 on placebos .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results show an association between bendrofluazide treatment and impotence , and impotence also occurred more frequently in patients taking propranolol than in those taking placebos .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Other adverse reactions significantly linked with active drugs include impaired glucose tolerance in men and women and gout in men , associated with bendrofluazide treatment , and Raynaud 's phenomenon

Differential diagnosis of high serum creatine kinase levels in systemic lupus erythematosus .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O
We report the clinical and bioptic findings for a 57 - year - old woman with severe chloroquine - induced myopathy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Since 1989 , she had been suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) with renal involvement and undergone periods of treatment with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
Additional therapy with chloroquine ( CQ ) was started because of arthralgia .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O
At the same time , slightly increased creatine kinase ( CK ) levels were noted .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Myositis was suspected , and the patient was treated with steroids .
O O O O O O O O O O B O
The CK increase persisted , however , and she developed progressive muscular weakness and muscular atrophy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Routine controls revealed markedly elevated CK levels of 1 , 700 U / l .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The neurological and electrophysiological findings were not typical of myositis .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , muscle biopsy of the deltoid muscle was performed in order to exclude polymyositis or toxic myopathy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As it revealed chloroquine - induced myopathy , medication was stopped .

Intravenous ribavirin treatment for severe adenovirus disease in immunocompromised children .
O B O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND : Adenovirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children , where case fatality rates as high as 50 % to 80
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
% have been reported .
O O O O O
There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease , nor are there any prospective randomized , controlled trials of potentially useful anti
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- adenovirus therapies .
O O O O
Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small series .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and cidofovir .
O O O O O B O B O
Ribavirin , a guanosine analogue , has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses , including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro .
B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ribavirin is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection , and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C . Intravenous ribavirin is the
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses .
O O O O O O O O O O
The most common adverse effect of intravenous ribavirin is reversible mild anemia .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O
The use of cidofovir in severe adenovirus infection has been limited by adverse effects , the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
We report our experience with intravenous ribavirin therapy for severe adenovirus disease in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DESIGN / METHODS :
O O O O
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous ribavirin for documented severe adenovirus disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Two patients developed adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis after cardiac and bone marrow transplants , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous cidofovir for progressive disseminated disease .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
An additional 3 children developed adenovirus pneumonia ; 2 were neonates , 1 of whom had partial DiGeorge syndrome .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The remaining infant had recently undergone a cardiac transplant .
O O O O O O O O O O
Intravenous ribavirin was administered on a compassionate - use protocol .
O B O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children : the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis and the immunocompetent neonate with adenovirus pneumonia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The remaining 3 children died of adenovirus disease .
O O O O O O O O O
Intravenous ribavirin therapy was well tolerated .
O B O O O O O
Use of cidofovir in 1 child was associated with progressive renal failure and neutropenia .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
DISCUSSION :
O O
Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe adenovirus disease , namely solid - organ and bone marrow transplant recipients ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
neonates , and children with immunodeficiency .
O O O O O O O
Although intravenous ribavirin was not effective for all children with severe adenovirus disease in this series or in the literature , therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
late in the course of the infection .
O O O O O O O O
Early identification , eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated adenovirus disease may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Two of 5 children with severe adenovirus disease treated with intravenous ribavirin recovered .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques , such as polymerase chain reaction , may make earlier , more effective treatment of adenovirus infection possible .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of adenovirus disease in certain hosts , especially children , a large , multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti - adenoviral therapies ,

Hepatotoxicity of amiodarone .
O O B O
Amiodarone has proved very effective in the treatment of otherwise resistant cardiac tachyarrhythmias .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The use of amiodarone has , however , been limited due to its serious side - effects .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A patient with cholestatic hepatitis due to amiodarone treatment is presented below and a review of the hepatotoxicity of amiodarone is given .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
It is concluded that solid evidence exists of hepatic injury due to amiodarone treatment , including steatosis , alterations resembling alcoholic hepatitis , cholestatic hepatitis and micronodular cirrhosis of the
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
liver .
O O
Patients receiving amiodarone should be regularly screened with respect to hepatic enzyme levels .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Therapy should be discontinued on the suspicion of cholestatic injury or hepatomegaly .

Catalepsy induced by combinations of ketamine and morphine : potentiation , antagonism , tolerance and cross - tolerance in the rat .
O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Previous studies demonstrated that both ketamine and morphine induced analgesia and catalepsy in the rat . Pre - treatment with ketamine produced cross - tolerance to morphine , whereas pretreatment
O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O
with morphine did not induce cross - tolerance to ketamine but rather augmented the cataleptic response ; this augmentation was attributed to residual morphine in the brain .
O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The present studies explored the duration of the loss of righting reflex induced by sub - effective doses of ketamine and morphine , administered simultaneously .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O
There was mutual potentiation between sub - effective doses of ketamine and morphine , but sub - effective doses of ketamine partly antagonized fully - effective doses of morphine .
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O
Latency to the loss of righting reflex , rigidity and behavior on recovery , reflected the relative predominance of ketamine or morphine in each combination .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O
Naloxone inhibited the induced cataleptic effects .
B O O O O O O
The degree and time course of development of tolerance to daily administration of sub - effective dose combinations of ketamine and morphine were similar .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O
Rats , tolerant to ketamine - dominant combinations , were cross - tolerant to both drugs , while those tolerant to morphine - dominant combinations were cross - tolerant to
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
morphine but showed either no cross - tolerance or an augmented response to ketamine .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
While the mutual potentiation , antagonism and tolerance suggest common mechanisms for the induced catalepsy , differences in latency , rigidity and behavior , asymmetry of cross - tolerance and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a widely - different ID50 for naloxone would argue against an action at a single opioid site .

Acute renal failure in patients with AIDS on tenofovir while receiving prolonged vancomycin course for osteomyelitis .
O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O
Renal failure developed after a prolonged course of vancomycin therapy in 2 patients who were receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate as part of an antiretroviral regimen .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
Tenofovir has been implicated in the development of Fanconi syndrome and renal insufficiency because of its effects on the proximal renal tubule .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Vancomycin nephrotoxicity is infrequent but may result from coadministration with a nephrotoxic agent .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinicians should be aware that tenofovir may raise the risk of renal failure during prolonged administration of vancomycin .

Delayed leukoencephalopathy with stroke - like presentation in chemotherapy recipients .
O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
A transient leukoencephalopathy mimicking cerebrovascular accident has been described as a complication of chemotherapy , most commonly in recipients of intrathecal methotrexate for childhood leukaemia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Recently published neuroimaging data suggest a common pathophysiology associated with a variety of chemotherapy agents and modes of administration .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
We reviewed the medical literature for single reports and case series of patients presenting with stroke - like episodes while receiving systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We only included studies providing detailed neuroimaging data .
O O O O O O O O O
Patients with cerebrovascular accidents were excluded .
O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
We identified 27 reports of toxic leukoencephalopathy in patients treated with methotrexate ( intrathecal , systemic ) , 5 - fluorouracil and its derivative carmofur , and capecitabine .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I O O O B O O B O
Diffusion weighted imaging ( DWI ) of all patients revealed well demarcated hyperintense lesions within the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres and the corpus callosum , corresponding to
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
areas of decreased proton diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) maps ( available in 21 / 27 patients ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories .
O O O O O O O O O
Complete resolution of symptoms within 1 - 4 days was accompanied by normalisation of ADC abnormalities .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR ) sequences frequently revealed persistent white matter abnormalities .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Several pathophysiological models of delayed leukoencephalopathy after exposure to intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy have been proposed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DWI findings in this cohort are indicative of cytotoxic oedema within cerebral white matter and lend support to an at least partially reversible metabolic derangement as the basis for this
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
syndrome .

Down - regulation of norepinephrine transporter function induced by chronic administration of desipramine linking to the alteration of sensitivity of local - anesthetics - induced convulsions and the counteraction by
O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
co - administration with local anesthetics .
O O O O O O O
Alterations of norepinephrine transporter ( NET ) function by chronic inhibition of NET in relation to sensitization to seizures induce by cocaine and local anesthetics were studied in mice .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Daily administration of desipramine , an inhibitor of the NET , for 5 days decreased [ ( 3 ) H ] norepinephrine uptake in the P2 fractions of hippocampus but
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
not cortex , striatum or amygdalae .
O O O O O O O
Co -
O O
administration of lidocaine , bupivacaine or tricaine with desipramine reversed this effect .
O O B O B O B O B O O O O
Daily treatment of cocaine increased [ ( 3 ) H ] norepinephrine uptake into the hippocampus .
O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Daily administration of desipramine increased the incidence of appearance of lidocaine - induced convulsions and decreased that of cocaine - induced convulsions .
O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O
Co -
O O
administration of lidocaine with desipramine reversed the changes of convulsive activity of lidocaine and cocaine induced by repeated administration of desipramine .
O O B O B O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O B O
These results suggest that down - regulation of hippocampal NET induced by chronic administration of desipramine may be relevant to desipramine - induced sensitization of lidocaine convulsions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O B O O
Inhibition of Na ( + ) channels by local anesthetics may regulate desipramine - induced down - regulation of NET function .
O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Repeated administration of cocaine induces up - regulation of hippocampal NET function .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Desipramine - induced sensitization of lidocaine seizures may have a mechanism distinct from kindling resulting from repeated administration of cocaine .

Definition and management of anemia in patients infected with hepatitis C virus .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) can progress to cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma , and end - stage liver disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The current best treatment for HCV infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
Although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses ( SVRs ) in approximately 50 % of patients , it can be associated with a potentially dose - limiting hemolytic anemia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of ribavirin - induced hemolysis , and this anemia can be problematic in patients with HCV infection , especially those who have comorbid
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
renal or cardiovascular disorders .
O O O O O
In general , anemia can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality , and may have negative effects on cerebral function and quality of life .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although ribavirin - associated anemia can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation , this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage ribavirin - associated anemia but has other potential disadvantages .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Viramidine , a liver - targeting prodrug of ribavirin , has the potential to maintain the virologic efficacy of ribavirin while decreasing the risk of hemolytic anemia in patients with
B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
chronic hepatitis C .

Calcium carbonate toxicity : the updated milk - alkali syndrome ; report of 3 cases and review of the literature .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To describe 3 patients with calcium carbonate - induced hypercalcemia and gain insights into the cause and management of the milk - alkali syndrome .
O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
We report the clinical and laboratory data in 3 patients who presented with severe hypercalcemia ( corrected serum calcium > or = 14 mg / dL ) and review the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
pertinent literature on milk - alkali syndrome .
O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The 3 patients had acute renal insufficiency , relative metabolic alkalosis , and low parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , PTH - related peptide , and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations .
B I I I I I O O
No malignant lesion was found .
O O O O O O
Treatment included aggressive hydration and varied amounts of furosemide .
O O O O O O O O B O
The 2 patients with the higher serum calcium concentrations received pamidronate intravenously ( 60 and 30 mg , respectively ) , which caused severe hypocalcemia .
O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of the 3 patients , 2 were ingesting acceptable doses of elemental calcium ( 1 g and 2 g daily , respectively ) in the form of calcium carbonate .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
In addition to our highlighted cases , we review the history , classification , pathophysiologic features , and treatment of milk - alkali syndrome and summarize the cases reported from
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
early 1995 to November 2003 .
O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Milk - alkali syndrome may be a common cause of unexplained hypercalcemia and can be precipitated by small amounts of orally ingested calcium carbonate in susceptible persons .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
Treatment with hydration , furosemide , and discontinuation of the calcium and vitamin D source is adequate .
O O O O B O O O O O B O B I O O O O
Pamidronate treatment is associated with considerable risk for hypocalcemia , even in cases of initially severe hypercalcemia .

Management strategies for ribavirin - induced hemolytic anemia in the treatment of hepatitis C : clinical and economic implications .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVES :
O O
Recently published studies have demonstrated increased efficacy and cost - effectiveness of combination therapy with interferon and alpha - 2b / ribavirin compared with interferon - alpha monotherapy in the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I O O O
treatment of chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) .
O O O O O O O O O
Combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect : ribavirin - induced hemolytic anemia ( RIHA ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health - care costs and management of RIHA during treatment of CHC in a clinical trial setting .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the incidence and management of RIHA .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Decision - analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating RIHA .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uncertainty was evaluated using sensitivity analyses .
O O O O O O O
RESULTS : RIHA , defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g / L , occurs in approximately 7 % to 9 % of patients treated with
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
combination therapy .
O O O
The standard of care for management of RIHA is reduction or discontinuation of the ribavirin dosage .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
We estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant RIHA to be 170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48 - week treatment course ( range
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
68 - 692 ) .
O O O O O
The results of the one - way sensitivity analyses ranged from 57 to 317 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In comparison , the cost of 48 weeks of combination therapy is 16 , 459 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
The direct cost of treating clinically significant RIHA is 1 % ( 170 / 16 , 459 ) of drug treatment costs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Questions remain about the optimal dose of ribavirin and the incidence of RIHA in a real - world population .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Despite these uncertainties , this initial evaluation of the direct cost of treating RIHA provides an estimate of the cost and management implications of this clinically important adverse effect .

Effects of amine pretreatment on ketamine catatonia in pinealectomized or hypophysectomized animals .
O O B O O B O O O O O O O
The present studies were designed to clarify the role of catecholamines and pineal idolamines on ketamine - induced catatonia in the intact , pinealectomized or hypophysectomized chick and rat .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the pinealectomized chick , pretreatment with dopamine increased the duration of catatonia ( DOC ) after ketamine , but pretreatment with norepinephrine did not .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O
The pineal indolamines exhibited mixed actions .
O O O O O O O
Serotonin and N - acetyl serotonin which augmented ketamine DOC , did not do so in the absence of the pineal gland , whereas melatonin potentiated the ketamine DOC in
B O B I I I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O
both the intact and pinealectomized chick .
O O O O O O O
Ketamine was more potent in the hypophysectomized chick and the circadian rhythm noted in the intact chick was absent ; furthermore , melatonin did not augment the ketamine DOC whereas
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O
dopamine continued to do so .
B O O O O O
This study did not demonstrate a species difference regarding the role of the amines on the pineal in spite of the immature blood - brain barrier in the young chick
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the intact barrier in the rat .
O O O O O O O O
In addition , these data indicate a direct role of the pituitary in the augmentation of ketamine DOC induced by melatonin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O
Furthermore , dopamine appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of ketamine catatonia rather than directly on the pituitary .

rhinitis .
O O
Azelastine , a novel antiallergic medication , was compared with chlorpheniramine maleate and placebo for efficacy and safety in the treatment of spring allergic rhinitis in a multicenter , double
B O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- blind , multiple - dose , parallel - groups study .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
One hundred fifty - five subjects participated .
O O O O O O O O
Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 60 years of age and had at least a 2 - year history of spring allergic rhinitis , confirmed by positive skin test
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to spring aeroallergens .
O O O O
Medications were given four times daily ; the azelastine groups received 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 , or 2 . 0 mg in the morning and evening with
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
placebo in the early and late afternoon ; the chlorpheniramine group received 4 . 0 mg four times daily .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Daily subject symptom cards were completed during a screening period to assess pretreatment symptoms and during a 4 - week treatment period while subjects received study medications .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Individual symptoms , total symptoms , and major symptoms were compared to determine efficacy of medication .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Elicited , volunteered , and observed adverse experiences were recorded for each subject and compared among groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Vital signs , body weights , serum chemistry values , complete blood cell counts , urine studies , and electrocardiograms were obtained for each subject and compared among groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Symptoms relief in the group receiving the highest concentration of azelastine ( 2 . 0 mg twice daily ) was statistically greater than in the placebo group during all weeks
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of the study .
O O O O
Lower doses of azelastine were statistically more effective than placebo only during portions of the first 3 weeks of the study .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , although the chlorpheniramine group did have fewer symptoms than the placebo group during the study , the difference never reached statistical significance during any week of the
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
study .
O O
There were no serious side effects in any of the treatment groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Drowsiness and altered taste perception were increased significantly over placebo only in the high - dose azelastine group .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Azelastine appears to be a safe , efficacious medication for seasonal allergic rhinitis .

Obsolete but dangerous antacid preparations .
O O O O O O
One case of acute hypercalcaemia and two of recurrent nephrolithiasis are reported in patients who had regularly consumed large amounts of calcium carbon - ate - sodium bicarbonate powders for
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I O O
more than 20 years .
O O O O O
The powders had been obtained from pharmacists unknown to the patients ' medical practitioners .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is suggested that these preparations were responsible for the patient 's problems , and that such powders should no longer be freely obtainable .

Prolonged paralysis due to nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and corticosteroids .
O O O O B I I I O B O
The long - term use of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents ( ND - NMBA ) has recently been implicated as a cause of prolonged muscle weakness , although the site
O O O O O O B I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of the lesion and the predisposing factors have been unclear .
O O O O O O O O O O O
We report 3 patients ( age 37 - 52 years ) with acute respiratory insufficiency who developed prolonged weakness following the discontinuation of ND - NMBAs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
Two patients also received intravenous corticosteroids .
O O O O O B O
Renal function was normal but hepatic function was impaired in all patients , and all had acidosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Electrophysiologic studies revealed low amplitude compound motor action potentials , normal sensory studies , and fibrillations .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Repetitive stimulation at 2 Hz showed a decremental response in 2 patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The serum vecuronium level measured in 1 patient 14 days after the drug had been discontinued was 172 ng / mL . A muscle biopsy in this patient showed loss
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of thick , myosin filaments .
O O O O O O
The weakness in these patients is due to pathology at both the neuromuscular junction ( most likely due to ND - NMBA ) and muscle ( most likely due to
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
corticosteroids ) .
B O O
Hepatic dysfunction and acidosis are contributing risk factors .

Prostaglandin E2 - induced bladder hyperactivity in normal , conscious rats : involvement of tachykinins ?
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
In normal conscious rats investigated by continuous cystometry , intravesically instilled prostaglandin ( PG ) E2 facilitated micturition and increased basal intravesical pressure .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O
The effect was attenuated by both the NK1 receptor selective antagonist RP 67 , 580 and the NK2 receptor selective antagonist SR 48 , 968 , given intra - arterially
O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O
, suggesting that it was mediated by stimulation of both NK1 and NK2 receptors .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Intra - arterially given PGE2 produced a distinct increase in bladder pressure before initiating a micturition reflex , indicating that the PG had a direct contractant effect on the detrusor
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
smooth muscle .
O O O
The effect of intra - arterial PGE2 could not be blocked by intra - arterial RP 67 , 580 or SR 48 , 968 , which opens the possibility that
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I I O O O O O O
the micturition reflex elicited by intra - arterial PGE2 was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the PG was given intravesically .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The present results thus suggest that intra - arterial PGE2 , given near the bladder , may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of the detrusor .
O O O O
However , when given intravesically , PGE2 may stimulate micturition by releasing tachykinins from nerves in and / or immediately below the urothelium .
O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
These tachykinins , in turn , initiate a micturition reflex by stimulating NK1 and NK2 receptors .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Prostanoids may , via release of tachykinins , contribute to both urge and bladder hyperactivity seen in inflammatory conditions of the lower urinary tract .

Diuretics , potassium and arrhythmias in hypertensive coronary disease .
O O B O O O O O O O
It has been proposed that modest changes in plasma potassium can alter the tendency towards cardiac arrhythmias .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
If this were so , patients with coronary artery disease might be especially susceptible .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential hypertension and known coronary artery disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a potassium - conserving diuretic (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
amiloride ) and a similar period on a potassium - losing diuretic ( chlorthalidone ) in a randomised study .
B O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O
Plasma potassium concentrations were on average 1 mmol / L lower during the chlorthalidone phase compared to amiloride therapy .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O
Blood pressure and volume states as assessed by bodyweight , plasma renin and noradrenaline ( norepinephrine ) concentrations were similar on the 2 regimens .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O
Compared to amiloride treatment , the chlorthalidone phase was associated with an increased frequency of ventricular ectopic beats ( 24 - hour Holter monitoring ) and a higher Lown grading
O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential , prolonged ventricular effective refractory period , and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The above results indicate that because potassium - losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with ischaemic heart disease , even minor falls in plasma potassium concentrations
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
are probably best avoided in such patients .

National project on the prevention of mother - to - infant infection by hepatitis B virus in Japan .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In Japan , a nationwide prevention program against mother - to - infant infection by hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) started in 1985 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This program consists of double screenings of pregnant women and prophylactic treatment to the infants born to both hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O O
hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) positive mothers .
B I I I O B O O O O
These infants are treated with two injections of hepatitis B immune globulin ( HBIG ) and at least three injections of plasma derived hepatitis B vaccine .

We sent questionnaires about the numbers of each procedure or examination during nine months of investigation period to each local government in 1986 and 1987 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
93 . 4 % pregnant women had the chance to be examined for HBsAg , and the positive rate was 1 . 4 to 1 . 5 % .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The HBeAg positive rate in HBsAg positive was 23 to 26 % .

Nociceptive effects induced by intrathecal administration of prostaglandin D2 , E2 , or F2 alpha to conscious mice .
O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O
The effects of intrathecal administration of prostaglandins on pain responses in conscious mice were evaluated by using hot plate and acetic acid writhing tests .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O
Prostaglandin D2 ( 0 . 5 - 3 ng / mouse ) had a hyperalgesic action on the response to a hot plate during a 3 - 60 min period
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after injection .
O O O
Prostaglandin E2 showed a hyperalgesic effect at doses of 1 pg to 10 ng / mouse , but the effect lasted shorter ( 3 - 30 min ) than that
B I O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of prostaglandin D2 .
O B I O
Similar results were obtained by acetic acid writhing tests .
O O O O O B I O O O
The hyperalgesic effect of prostaglandin D2 was blocked by simultaneous injection of a substance P antagonist ( greater than or equal to 100 ng ) but not by AH6809 ,
O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
a prostanoid EP1 - receptor antagonist .
O O O O O O O
Conversely , prostaglandin E2 - induced hyperalgesia was blocked by AH6809 ( greater than or equal to 500 ng ) but not by the substance P antagonist .
O O B I O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Prostaglandin F2 alpha had little effect on pain responses .
B I I O O O O O O O
These results demonstrate that both prostaglandin D2 and prostaglandin E2 exert hyperalgesia in the spinal cord , but in different ways .

Swallowing - induced atrial tachyarrhythmia triggered by salbutamol : case report and review of the literature .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
CASE :
O O
A 49 - year - old patient experienced chest discomfort while swallowing .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On electrocardiogram , episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmia were recorded immediately after swallowing ; 24 - hour Holter monitoring recorded several events .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The arrhythmia resolved after therapy with atenolol , but recurred a year later .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The patient noticed that before these episodes he had been using an inhalator of salbutamol .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
After stopping the beta - agonist , and after a week with the atenolol , the arrhythmia disappeared .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
DISCUSSION :
O O
Swallowing - induced atrial tachyarrhythmia ( SIAT ) is a rare phenomenon .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fewer than 50 cases of SIAT have been described in the literature .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This article summarizes all the cases published , creating a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and approach to SIAT .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It discusses demographics , clinical characteristics and types of arrhythmia , postulated mechanisms of SIAT , and different treatment possibilities such as medications , surgery , and radiofrequency catheter ablation

( RFCA ) .
O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Salbutamol is presented here as a possible trigger for SIAT .
B O O O O O O O O O O
Although it is difficult to define causality in a case report , it is logical to think that a beta - agonist like salbutamol ( known to induce tachycardia )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta - blocker such as atenolol ( that blocks the adrenergic activity ) may
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
relieve it .

Coenzyme Q10 treatment ameliorates acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity in mice .
B I O O O B O O O O
The nephroprotective effect of coenzyme Q10 was investigated in mice with acute renal injury induced by a single i . p .
O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
injection of cisplatin ( 5 mg / kg ) .
O O B O O O O O O O
Coenzyme Q10 treatment ( 10 mg / kg / day , i . p . ) was applied for 6 consecutive days , starting 1 day before cisplatin administration .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Coenzyme Q10 significantly reduced blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels which were increased by cisplatin .
B I O O B I I O O B O O O O O B O
Coenzyme Q10 significantly compensated deficits in the antioxidant defense mechanisms ( reduced glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity ) , suppressed lipid peroxidation , decreased the elevations of tumor necrosis
B I O O O O O O O O O B I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
factor - alpha , nitric oxide and platinum ion concentration , and attenuated the reductions of selenium and zinc ions in renal tissue resulted from cisplatin administration .
O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O B O O
Also , histopathological renal tissue damage mediated by cisplatin was ameliorated by coenzyme Q10 treatment .
O O O O O O O O B O O O B I O O
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that coenzyme Q10 significantly decreased the cisplatin - induced overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase , nuclear factor - kappaB , caspase - 3 and p53 in
O O O O B I O O O B O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
renal tissue .
O O O
It was concluded that coenzyme Q10 represents a potential therapeutic option to protect against acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity commonly encountered in clinical practice .

Metformin prevents experimental gentamicin - induced nephropathy by a mitochondria - dependent pathway .
B O O B O O O O O O O O O O
The antidiabetic drug metformin can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent vascular dysfunction even in nondiabetic patients .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of gentamicin toxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Mitochondrial analysis , respiration intensity , levels of reactive oxygen species , permeability transition , and cytochrome c release were assessed 3 and 6 days after gentamicin administration .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Metformin treatment fully blocked gentamicin - mediated acute renal failure .
B O O O B O O O O O O
This was accompanied by a lower activity of N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase , together with a decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of antioxidant systems
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Metformin also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after gentamicin administration .
B O O O O O O O O O O B O O
These in vivo markers of kidney dysfunction and their correction by metformin were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
We found that gentamicin treatment depleted respiratory components ( cytochrome c , NADH ) , probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These injuries , partly mediated by a rise in reactive oxygen species from the electron transfer chain , were significantly decreased by metformin .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Thus , our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of metformin can lessen gentamicin nephrotoxicity and improve mitochondrial homeostasis .

Sedation depth during spinal anesthesia and the development of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture repair .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To determine whether limiting intraoperative sedation depth during spinal anesthesia for hip fracture repair in elderly patients can decrease the prevalence of postoperative delirium .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PATIENTS AND METHODS :
O O O O
We performed a double - blind , randomized controlled trial at an academic medical center of elderly patients ( > or = 65 years ) without preoperative delirium or severe
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dementia who underwent hip fracture repair under spinal anesthesia with propofol sedation .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Sedation depth was titrated using processed electroencephalography with the bispectral index ( BIS ) , and patients were randomized to receive either deep ( BIS , approximately 50 ) or
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
light ( BIS , > or = 80 ) sedation .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Postoperative delirium was assessed as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( Third Edition Revised ) criteria using the Confusion Assessment Method beginning at any time from
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the second day after surgery .
O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
From April 2 , 2005 , through October 30 , 2008 , a total of 114 patients were randomized .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The prevalence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the light sedation group ( 11 / 57 [ 19 % ] vs 23 / 57 [ 40 % ] in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the deep sedation group ; P = . 02 ) , indicating that 1 incident of delirium will be prevented for every 4 . 7 patients treated with light sedation
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.

The use of light propofol sedation decreased the prevalence of postoperative delirium by 50 % compared with deep sedation .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Limiting depth of sedation during spinal anesthesia is a simple , safe , and cost - effective intervention for preventing postoperative delirium in elderly patients that could be widely and

Sorafenib - induced acute myocardial infarction due to coronary artery spasm .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
A 65 - year - old man with advanced renal cell carcinoma was admitted due to continuing chest pain at rest .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two weeks before his admission , sorafenib had been started .
O O O O O O B O O O O
He was diagnosed with non - ST - elevation myocardial infarction by laboratory data and electrocardiogram .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Enhanced heart magnetic resonance imaging also showed subendocardial infarction .
O O O O O O O O O O
However , there was no stenosis in coronary arteries on angiography .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Coronary artery spasm was induced by a provocative test .
O O O O O O O O O O
Cessation of sorafenib and administration of Ca - channel blocker and nitrates ameliorated his symptoms , but relapse occurred after resumption of sorafenib .
O O B O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O
Addition of oral nicorandil reduced his symptoms and maintained stable angina status .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O
We report the first case of sorafenib - induced coronary artery spasm .

Anxiogenic potential of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin in rats .
O O O B O B O O O
INTRODUCTION :
O O
The possible anxiogenic effects of fluoroquinolones , namely ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin , were investigated in adult Charles Foster albino rats of either sex , weighing 150 - 200 g .
O O O O O B O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
The drugs were given orally , in doses of 50 mg / kg for five consecutive days and the experiments were performed on the fifth day .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The tests included open - field exploratory behaviour , elevated plus maze and elevated zero maze , social interaction and novelty - suppressed feeding latency behaviour .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The results indicate that ciprofloxacin - and norfloxacin - treated rats showed anxious behaviour in comparison to control rats in all the parameters studied .
O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , ciprofloxacin - and norfloxacin - treated rats did not differ significantly from each other in various behavioural parameters .
O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :

Myocardial Fas ligand expression increases susceptibility to AZT - induced cardiomyopathy .
O O O O O O O B O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) and myocarditis occur in many HIV - infected individuals , resulting in symptomatic heart failure in up to 5 % of patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , but has resulted in an increase in cardiac and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
skeletal myopathies .
O O O
METHODS AND RESULTS :
O O O O
In order to investigate whether the HAART component zidovudine ( 3' - azido - 2' , 3' - deoxythymidine ; AZT ) triggers the Fas - dependent cell - death
O O O O O O O O B O B I I I I I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O
pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of DCM , 8 - week - old transgenic ( expressing Fas ligand in the myocardium : FasL Tg ) and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
non - transgenic ( NTg ) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of AZT ( 0 , 0 . 07 , 0 . 2 , and 0 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
7 mg / ml ) .
O O O O O O
After 6 weeks , cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and morphology was assessed by histopathologic and immunohistochemical methods .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
NTg and untreated FasL
O O O O
Tg mice showed little or no change in cardiac structure or function .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , AZT - treated FasL Tg mice developed cardiac dilation and depressed cardiac function in a dose - dependent manner , with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
These changes were associated with an increased sarcolemmal expression of Fas and FasL , as well as increased activation of caspase 3 , translocation of calpain 1 to the sarcolemma
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and sarcomere , and increased numbers of cells undergoing apoptosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O
These were associated with changes in dystrophin and cardiac troponin I localization , as well as loss of sarcolemmal integrity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
The expression of Fas ligand in the myocardium , as identified in HIV - positive patients , might increase the susceptibility to HAART - induced cardiomyopathy due to activation of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apoptotic pathways , resulting in cardiac dilation and dysfunction .

Valproate - induced chorea and encephalopathy in atypical nonketotic hyperglycinemia .
B O O O O O O O O O O
Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is a disorder of amino acid metabolism in which a defect in the glycine cleavage system leads to an accumulation of glycine in the brain and other body

compartments .
O O
In the classical form it presents as neonatal apnea , intractable seizures , and hypotonia , followed by significant psychomotor retardation .

Microinjection of ritanserin into the CA1 region of hippocampus improves scopolamine - induced amnesia in adult male rats .
O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
The effect of ritanserin ( 5 - HT2 antagonist ) on scopolamine ( muscarinic cholinergic antagonist ) - induced amnesia in Morris water maze ( MWM ) was investigated .
O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Rats were divided into eight groups and bilaterally cannulated into CA1 region of the hippocampus .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One week later , they received repeatedly vehicles ( saline , DMSO , saline + DMSO ) , scopolamine ( 2 microg / 0 . 5 microl saline / side
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
; 30 min before training ) , ritanserin ( 2 , 4 and 8 microg / 0 . 5 microl DMSO / side ; 20 min before training ) and
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
scopolamine ( 2 microg / 0 . 5 microl ; 30 min before ritanserin injection ) + ritanserin ( 4 microg / 0 . 5 microl DMSO ) through cannulae
B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O
each day .
O O O
Animals were tested for four consecutive days ( 4 trial / day ) in MWM during which the position of hidden platform was unchanged .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the fifth day , the platform was elevated above the water surface in another position to evaluate the function of motor , motivational and visual systems .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results showed a significant increase in escape latencies and traveled distances to find platform in scopolamine - treated group as compared to saline group .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Ritanserin - treated rats ( 4 microg / 0 . 5 microl / side ) showed a significant decrease in the mentioned parameters as compared to DMSO - treated group
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
.

However , scopolamine and ritanserin co - administration resulted in a significant decrease in escape latencies and traveled distances as compared to the scopolamine - treated rats .
O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Our findings show that microinjection of ritanserin into the CA1 region of the hippocampus improves the scopolamine - induced amnesia .

generated a novel hypoxia - sensing transgenic rat .
O O O O O O O O O
We then applied this animal model to the detection of tubulointerstitial hypoxia in the diseased kidney .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
With this model , we were able to identify diffuse cortical hypoxia in the puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrotic syndrome and focal and segmental hypoxia in the remnant kidney model
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Expression of the hypoxia - responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period , reaching 2 . 2 - fold at 2 weeks in the puromycin aminonucleoside model and 2 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
6 - fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model , whereas that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a mild decrease , reflecting distinct behaviors of the two
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
genes .
O O
The degree of hypoxia showed a positive correlation with microscopic tubulointerstitial injury in both models .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Finally , we identified the localization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen - positive , ED - 1 - positive , and terminal dUTP nick - end labeled - positive cells
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the hypoxic cortical area in the remnant kidney model .
O O O O O O O O O O O
We propose here a possible pathological tie between chronic tubulointerstitial hypoxia and progressive glomerular diseases .

Consensus statement concerning cardiotoxicity occurring during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of autoimmune diseases , with special reference to systemic sclerosis and multiple sclerosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is now a feasible and effective treatment for selected patients with severe autoimmune diseases .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Worldwide , over 650 patients have been transplanted in the context of phase I and II clinical trials .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results are encouraging enough to begin randomised phase III trials .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , as predicted , significant transplant - related morbidity and mortality have been observed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is primarily due to complications related to either the stage of the disease at transplant or due to infections .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The number of deaths related to cardiac toxicity is low .
O O O O O O O O O O O
However , caution is required when cyclophosphamide or anthracyclines such as mitoxantrone are used in patients with a possible underlying heart damage , for example , systemic sclerosis patients .

In November 2002 , a meeting was held in Florence , bringing together a number of experts in various fields , including rheumatology , cardiology , neurology , pharmacology and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
transplantation medicine .
O O O
The object of the meeting was to analyse existing data , both published or available , in the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation autoimmune disease database , and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to propose a safe approach to such patients .
O O O O O O O O O
A full cardiological assessment before and during the transplant emerged as the major recommendation .

Immunohistochemical study on inducible type of nitric oxide ( iNOS ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) and tumor growth factor - beta1 ( TGF - beta1 )
O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in arteritis induced in rats by fenoldopam and theophylline , vasodilators .
O O O O O O B O B O O O
Arteritis induced in rats by vasodilators , fenoldopam and theophylline , was examined immunohistochemically for expressions of inducible type of nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , basic fibroblast growth
O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
factor ( bFGF ) and tumor growth factor - beta1 ( TGF - beta1 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Rats were administered fenoldopam for 24 hours by intravenous infusion with or without following repeated daily oral administrations of theophylline .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Irrespective of theophylline administration , iNOS antigens were remarkably abundant in ED - 1 - positive cells on day 5 and 8 post - fenoldopam - infusion ( DPI )
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
; bFGF antigens were remarkably abundant in ED - 1 - positive cells on 1 and 3 DPI ; TGF - beta1 antigens were observed in ED - 1 -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
positive cells on and after 5 DPI .
O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that the peak expression of iNOS antigen was followed by that of bFGF antigen , and bFGF may have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rat arteritis models .
O O O O
On the other hand , TGF - beta1 was not considered to have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these models .

Low - molecular - weight heparin for the treatment of patients with mechanical heart valves .
B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
The interruption of oral anticoagulant ( OAC ) administration is sometimes indicated in patients with mechanical heart valves , mainly before noncardiac surgery , non - surgical interventions , and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pregnancy .
O O
Unfractionated heparin ( UH ) is currently the substitute for selected patients .
B I O B O O O O O O O O O
Low - molecular - weight heparin ( LMWH ) offers theoretical advantages over UH , but is not currently considered in clinical guidelines as an alternative to UH in patients
B I I I I I O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
with prosthetic valves .
O O O O
HYPOTHESIS :
O O
The aim of the present study was to review the data accumulated so far on the use of LMWH in this patient population and to discuss its applicability in common
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
practice .
O O
METHODS :
O O
For this paper , the current medical literature on LMWH in patients with mechanical heart valves was extensively reviewed .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
There were eight series and six case reports .
O O O O O O O O O
None of the studies was randomized , and only one was prospective .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Data to establish the thromboembolic risk were incomplete .
O O O O O O O O O
After excluding case reports , the following groups were constructed : ( a ) short - term administration , after valve insertion ( n = 212 ) ; ( b
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) short - term , perioperative ( noncardiac ) / periprocedural ( n = 114 ) ; ( c ) long - term , due to intolerance to OAC (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
n = 16 ) ; ( d ) long - term , in pregnancy ( n = 10 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The incidence rate of thromboembolism was 0 . 9 % for all the studies and 0 . 5 , 0 , 20 , and 0 % in groups a ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
b , c , and d , respectively ; for hemorrhage , the overall rate was 3 . 4 % ( 3 . 8 , 2 . 6 , 10
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, and 0 % for the respective groups ) .
O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
In patients with mechanical heart valves , short - term LMWH therapy compares favorably with UH .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O
Data on mid - and long - term LMWH administration in these patients are sparse .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Further randomized studies are needed to confirm the safety and precise indications for the use of LMWH in patients with mechanical heart valves .

Topiramate - induced nephrolithiasis .
B O O O O
Topiramate is a recently developed antiepileptic medication that is becoming more widely prescribed because of its efficacy in treating refractory seizures .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Urologists should be aware that this medication can cause metabolic acidosis in patients secondary to inhibition of carbonic anhydrase .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , a distal tubular acidification defect may result , thus impairing the normal compensatory drop in urine pH . These factors can lead to the development of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
calcium phosphate nephrolithiasis .
B I O O
We report the first two cases of topiramate - induced nephrolithiasis in the urologic literature .

Spironolactone : is it a novel drug for the prevention of amphotericin B - related hypokalemia in cancer patients ?
B O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE : Nephrotoxicity is the major adverse effect of amphotericin B ( AmB ) , often limiting administration of full dosage .
O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O
Selective distal tubular epithelial toxicity seems to be responsible for the profound potassium wasting that is a major clinical side effect of treatment with AmB . Potassium depletion also potentiates
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O
the tubular toxicity of AmB .
O O O O B O
This study was designed to assess the ability of spironolactone to reduce potassium requirements and to prevent hypokalemia in neutropenic patients on AmB treatment .
O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O
METHODS :
O O
In this study 26 patients with various hematological disorders were randomized to receive either intravenous AmB alone or AmB and oral spironolactone 100 mg twice daily when developing a proven
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O B O O O O O O O O
or suspected fungal infection .
O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Patients receiving concomitant AmB and spironolactone had significantly higher plasma potassium levels than those receiving AmB alone ( P = 0 . 0027 ) .
O O O B O B O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Those patients receiving AmB and spironolactone required significantly less potassium supplementation to maintain their plasma potassium within the normal range ( P = 0 . 022 ) .
O O O B O B O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Moreover , urinary potassium losses were significantly less in patients receiving AmB and spironolactone than those receiving AmB alone ( P = 0 . 040 ) .
O O O B O O O O O O O B O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
This study showed that spironolactone can reduce potassium requirements and prevent hypokalemia by reducing urinary potassium loss in neutropenic patients on AmB treatment .

Dopamine D2 receptor signaling controls neuronal cell death induced by muscarinic and glutamatergic drugs .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Dopamine ( DA ) , through D1 / D2 receptor - mediated signaling , plays a major role in the control of epileptic seizures arising in the limbic system .
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Excitotoxicity leading to neuronal cell death in the affected areas is a major consequence of seizures at the cellular level .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this respect , little is known about the role of DA receptors in the occurrence of epilepsy - induced neuronal cell death .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here we analyze the occurrence of seizures and neurotoxicity in D2R - / - mice treated with the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
We compared these results with those previously obtained with kainic acid ( KA ) , a potent glutamate agonist .
O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O B O O
Importantly , D2R - / - mice develop seizures at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for WT littermates and show greater neurotoxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , pilocarpine - induced seizures result in a more widespread neuronal death in both WT and D2R - / - brains in comparison to KA .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Thus , the absence of D2R lowers the threshold for seizures induced by both glutamate and acetylcholine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
Moreover , the dopaminergic control of epilepsy - induced neurodegeneration seems to be mediated by distinct interactions of D2R signaling with these two neurotransmitters .

Treatment of risperidone - induced hyperprolactinemia with a dopamine agonist in children .
O O B O O O O O B O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Risperidone , a potent antagonist of both serotonergic ( 5HT2A ) and dopaminergic D2 receptors is associated with hyperprolactinemia in adults and children .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Chronically elevated prolactin levels in children with prolactinomas may be associated with arrested growth and development resulting in either delayed puberty or short stature .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These possibilities stress the importance of developing a safe and effective approach to drug - induced hyperprolactinemia in youth .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We report the successful treatment of risperidone - induced hyperprolactinemia with cabergoline in youth .
O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O
METHODS :
O O
We undertook a retrospective case review of four children with risperidone - induced hyperprolactinemia treated with cabergoline .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O
RESULTS :
O O
Four males ( age 6 - 11 years ) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( fourth edition ) bipolar disorder or psychoses , with risperidone - induced
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
elevations in serum prolactin levels ( 57 . 5 - 129 ng / mL , normal 5 - 15 ng / mL ) , were treated with cabergoline ( mean
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
dose 2 . 13 + / -
O O O O O O O
0 . 09 mg / week ) .
O O O O O O O O
When serum prolactin levels normalized in all four subjects ( mean 11 . 2 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
10 . 9 ng / mL ) , the cabergoline dose was reduced to 1 mg / week in three of four subjects .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mean duration of therapy with cabergoline was 523 . 5 + / -
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
129 . 7 days , and the mean duration of therapy with risperidone was 788 . 5 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
162 . 5 days .
O O O O O
Cabergoline was well tolerated without adverse effects .
B O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Cabergoline may be useful for the treatment of risperidone - induced hyperprolactinemia in youth ; however , further research is needed .

Cholestatic jaundice associated with the use of metformin .
O O O O O O O B O
We report a patient who developed cholestatic jaundice shortly after initiation of treatment with metformin hydrochloride .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Ultrasound of the liver and abdominal CT were normal .
O O O O O O O O O O
An ERCP showed normal biliary anatomy .
O O O O O O O
A percutaneous liver biopsy was obtained showing marked cholestasis , with portal edema , ductular proliferation , and acute inflammation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Metformin hydrochloride was discontinued , and the patient 's jaundice resolved slowly over a period of several months .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Given the onset of his jaundice 2 wk after the initiation of metformin , we believe that this case represents an example of metformin - associated hepatotoxicity , the first

Electro - oculography , electroretinography , visual evoked potentials , and multifocal electroretinography in patients with vigabatrin - attributed visual field constriction .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
PURPOSE :
O O
Symptomatic visual field constriction thought to be associated with vigabatrin has been reported .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The current study investigated the visual fields and visual electrophysiology of eight patients with known vigabatrin - attributed visual field loss , three of whom were reported previously .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Six of the patients were no longer receiving vigabatrin .
O O O O O O O O B O
METHODS :
O O
The central and peripheral fields were examined with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Full visual electrophysiology , including flash electroretinography ( ERG ) , pattern electroretinography , multifocal ERG using the VERIS system , electro - oculography , and flash and pattern visual
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
evoked potentials , was undertaken .
O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Seven patients showed marked visual field constriction with some sparing of the temporal visual field .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The eighth exhibited concentric constriction .
O O O O O O
Most electrophysiological responses were usually just within normal limits ; two patients had subnormal Arden electro - oculography indices ; and one patient showed an abnormally delayed photopic b wave
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
However , five patients showed delayed 30 - Hz flicker b waves , and seven patients showed delayed oscillatory potentials .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Multifocal ERG showed abnormalities that sometimes correlated with the visual field appearance and confirmed that the deficit occurs at the retinal level .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Marked visual field constriction appears to be associated with vigabatrin therapy .
O O O O O O O O O B O O
The field defects and some electrophysiological abnormalities persist when vigabatrin therapy is withdrawn .

Conversion to rapamycin immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients : report of an initial experience .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of RAPA conversion in patients undergoing cyclosporine ( CsA ) or tacrolimus ( Tac ) toxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O B O O B O B O O O
METHODS :
O O
Twenty renal transplant recipients were switched to fixed dose rapamycin ( RAPA ) ( 5 mg / day ) 0 to 204 months posttransplant .
O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Drug monitoring was not initially used to adjust doses .
O O O O O O O O O O
The indications for switch were chronic CsA or Tac nephrotoxicity ( 12 ) , acute CsA or Tac toxicity ( 3 ) , severe facial dysmorphism ( 2 ) ,
O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) in remission ( 2 ) , and hepatotoxicity in 1 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Follow - up is 7 to 24 months .
O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
In the 12 patients switched because of chronic nephrotoxicity there was a significant decrease in serum creatinine
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B
[ 233 + / - 34 to 210 + / - 56 micromol / liter ( P < 0 . 05 ) at 6 months ] .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Facial dysmorphism improved in two patients .
O O O O O O O
No relapse of PTLD was observed .
O O O O O O O
Five patients developed pneumonia ( two Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia , one infectious mononucleosis with polyclonal PTLD lung infiltrate ) and two had bronchiolitis obliterans .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There were no deaths .
O O O O O
RAPA was discontinued in four patients , because of pneumonia in two , PTLD in one , and oral aphtous ulcers in one .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RAPA levels were high ( > 15 ng / ml ) in 7 of 13 ( 54 % ) patients .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
RAPA conversion provides adequate immunosuppression to enable CsA withdrawal .
B O O O O O O B O O
However , when converting patients to RAPA drug levels should be monitored to avoid over - immunosuppression and adequate antiviral and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis should be given .

Worsening of levodopa - induced dyskinesias by motor and mental tasks .
O O B O O O O O O O O O
Ten patients who had Parkinson 's disease with disabling dyskinesia were included in this study to evaluate the role of mental ( mental calculation ) and motor ( flexion /

dyskinesia following administration of an effective single dose of apomorphine .
O O O O O O O O O B O
Compared with the score at rest ( 1 . 3 + / - 0 . 3 ) , a significant aggravation of the dyskinesia score was observed during speaking aloud
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( 5 . 2 + / - 1 . 1 , p < 0 . 05 ) , movements of right ( 4 . 5 + / - 1 .

Structural and functional impairment of mitochondria in adriamycin - induced cardiomyopathy in mice : suppression of cytochrome c oxidase II gene expression .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The use of adriamycin ( ADR ) in cancer chemotherapy has been limited due to its cumulative cardiovascular toxicity .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Earlier observations that ADR interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase ( COX ) and suppresses its enzyme activity led us to investigate ADR 's action on the cardiovascular functions and
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
heart mitochondrial morphology in Balb - c mice i . p .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
treated with ADR for several weeks .
O O B O O O O
At various times during treatment , the animals were assessed for cardiovascular functions by electrocardiography and for heart tissue damage by electron microscopy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In parallel , total RNA was extracted from samples of dissected heart and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to determine the steady - state level of three RNA transcripts encoded
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by the COXII , COXIII , and COXIV genes .
O O O O O O O O O O
Similarly , samples obtained from the liver of the same animals were analyzed for comparative studies .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our results indicated that 1 ) treatment of mice with ADR caused cardiovascular arrhythmias characterized by bradycardia , extension of ventricular depolarization time ( tQRS ) , and failure of
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
QRS at high concentrations ( 10 - 14 mg / kg body weight cumulative dose ) ; 2 ) the heart mitochondria underwent swelling , fusion , dissolution , and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
/ or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Such abnormalities were not observed in the mitochondria of liver tissue ; and 3 ) among the three genes of COX enzyme examined , only COXII gene expression was suppressed
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by ADR treatment , mainly after 8 weeks in both heart and liver .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Knowing that heart mitochondria represent almost 40 % of heart muscle by weight , we conclude that the deteriorating effects of ADR on cardiovascular function involve mitochondrial structural and functional

impairment .

Enhanced bradycardia induced by beta - adrenoceptor antagonists in rats pretreated with isoniazid .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
High doses of isoniazid increase hypotension induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex tachycardia to bradycardia , an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) .
B I I I O B O O
In the present study , the possible enhancement by isoniazid of bradycardia induced by beta - adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthetised with chloralose - urethane .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
Isoniazid significantly increased bradycardia after propranolol , pindolol , labetalol and atenolol , as well as after clonidine , but not after hexamethonium or carbachol .
B O O O O B O B O B O B O O O O O B O O O O B O B O
Enhancement was not observed in rats pretreated with methylatropine or previously vagotomised .

One epileptic woman delivered a newborn with cleft lip and palate .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Another patient exhibited with a cluster of seizures after the periconception period using another multivitamin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This 22 - year - old epileptic woman was treated continuously by carbamazepine and a folic acid ( 1 mg ) - containing multivitamin from the 20th week of gestation

She developed status epilepticus and later symptoms of systemic lupus erythematodes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Her pregnancy ended with stillbirth .
O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
The epileptic pregnant patient 's autoimmune disease ( probably drug - induced lupus ) could damage the blood - brain barrier , therefore the therapeutic dose ( > or =
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 mg ) of folic acid triggered a cluster of seizures .
O O O O B I O O O O O O
Physiological dose ( < 1 mg ) of folic acid both in healthy and 60 epileptic women , all without any autoimmune disease , did not increase the risk for

Irritable bowel syndrome is a common cause of abdominal pain and discomfort and may be related to disordered gastrointestinal motility .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our aim was to assess the effects of long - term treatment with a prokinetic agent , cisapride , on postprandial jejunal motility and symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome

Clarithromycin - induced ventricular tachycardia .
B O O O O O
Clarithromycin is a relatively new macrolide antibiotic that offers twice - daily dosing .
B O O O O B O O O O O O O O
It differs from erythromycin only in the methylation of the hydroxyl group at position 6 .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although the side - effect profile of erythromycin is established , including gastroenteritis and interactions with other drugs subject to hepatic mixed - function oxidase metabolism , experience with the
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
newer macrolides is still being recorded .
O B O O O O O
Cardiotoxicity has been demonstrated after both intravenous and oral administration of erythromycin but has never been reported with the newer macrolides .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O
We report a case of ventricular dysrhythmias that occurred after six therapeutic doses of clarithromycin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The dysrhythmias resolved after discontinuation of the drug .

Persistent nephrogenic diabetes insipidus following lithium therapy .
O O O O O B O O
We report the case of a patient who developed severe hypernatraemic dehydration following a head injury .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ten years previously he had been diagnosed to have lithium - induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus , and lithium therapy had been discontinued .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O
He remained thirsty and polyuric despite cessation of lithium and investigations on admission showed him to have normal osmoregulated thirst and vasopressin secretion , with clear evidence of nephrogenic diabetes
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
insipidus .
O O
Lithium induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is considered to be reversible on cessation of therapy but polyuria persisted in this patient for ten years after lithium was stopped .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
We discuss the possible renal mechanisms and the implications for management of patients with lithium - induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus .

Late cardiotoxicity after treatment for a malignant bone tumor .
O O O O O O O O O O
Cardiac function was assessed in long - term survivors of malignant bone tumors who were treated according to Rosen 's T5 or T10 protocol , both including doxorubicin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O B O
Thirty - one patients , age 10 - 45 years ( median age 17 . 8 years ) were evaluated 2 . 3 - 14 . 1 years ( median
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8 . 9 years ) following completion of treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O
Cumulative doses of doxorubicin were 225 - 550 mg / m2 ( median dose 360 ) .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The evaluation consisted of a history , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , signal averaged ECG , 24 - hour ambulatory ECG , echocardiography and radionuclide angiography .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Eighteen of 31 ( 58 % ) patients showed cardiac toxicity , defined as having one or more of the following abnormalities : late potentials , complex ventricular arrhythmias ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
left ventricular dilation , decreased shortening fraction , or decreased ejection fraction .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The incidence of cardiac abnormalities increased with length of follow - up ( P < or = . 05 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No correlation could be demonstrated between cumulative dose of doxorubicin and cardiac status , except for heart rate variability .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
When adjusted to body surface area , the left ventricular posterior wall thickness ( LVPW index ) was decreased in all patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The incidence of doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity is high and increases with follow - up , irrespective of cumulative dose .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Life - long cardiac follow - up in these patients is warranted .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results of our study suggest that heart rate variability and LVPW index could be sensitive indicators for cardiotoxicity .

Venous complications of midazolam versus diazepam .
O O O B O B O
Although some studies have suggested fewer venous complications are associated with midazolam than with diazepam for endoscopic procedures , this variable has not been well documented .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
We prospectively evaluated the incidence of venous complications after intravenous injection of diazepam or midazolam in 122 consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O
Overall , venous complications were more frequent with diazepam ( 22 of 62 patients ) than with midazolam ( 4 of 60 patients ) ( p < 0 . 001
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
) .
O O
A palpable venous cord was present in 23 % ( 14 of 62 ) of patients in the diazepam group , compared with 2 % ( 1 of 60 patients
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
) in the midazolam group ( p < 0 . 002 ) .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Pain at the injection site occurred in 35 % ( 22 of 62 ) of patients in the diazepam group compared with 7 % ( 4 of 60 patients )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
in the midazolam group ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
O O B O O O O O O O O O
Swelling and warmth at the injection site were not significantly different between the two groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Smoking , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug use , intravenous catheter site , dwell time of the needle , alcohol use , and pain during the injection had no effect
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
on the incidence of venous complications .

Tetany and rhabdomyolysis due to surreptitious furosemide - - importance of magnesium supplementation .
O O O O O O B O O O O B O O
Diuretics may induce hypokalemia , hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia .
O O O O O O O O O
While severe hypokalemia may cause muscle weakness , severe hypomagnesemia is associated with muscle spasms and tetany which can not be corrected by potassium and calcium supplementation alone ( 1
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O
, 2 ) .
O O O O
Surreptitious diuretic ingestion has been described , mainly in women who are concerned that they are obese or edematous .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Symptomatic hypokalemia has been reported in such patients ( 3 - 7 ) and in one case hypocalcemia was observed ( 8 ) , but the effects of magnesium depletion

Loss of glutamate decarboxylase mRNA - containing neurons in the rat dentate gyrus following pilocarpine - induced seizures .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
In situ hybridization methods were used to determine if glutamic acid decarboxylase ( GAD ) mRNA - containing neurons within the hilus of the dentate gyrus are vulnerable to seizure
O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- induced damage in a model of chronic seizures .
O O O O O O O O O O
Sprague - Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with pilocarpine , and the hippocampal formation was studied histologically at 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 week intervals after
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pilocarpine - induced seizures .
B O O O O
In situ hybridization histochemistry , using a digoxigenin - labeled GAD cRNA probe , demonstrated a substantial decrease in the number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of the dentate gyrus in the pilocarpine - treated rats as compared to controls at all time intervals .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Additional neuronanatomical studies , including cresyl violet staining , neuronal degeneration methods , and histochemical localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein , suggested that the decrease in the number of
O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
GAD mRNA - containing neurons was related to neuronal loss rather than to a decrease in GAD mRNA levels .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The loss of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus contrasted with the relative preservation of labeled putative basket cells along the inner margin of the granule cell layer
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Quantitative analyses of labeled neurons in three regions of the dentate gyrus in the 1 and 2 week groups showed statistically significant decreases in the mean number of GAD mRNA
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- containing neurons in the hilus of both groups of experimental animals .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No significant differences were found in the molecular layer or the granule cell layer , which included labeled neurons along the lower margin of the granule cell layer .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results indicate that , in this model , a subpopulation of GAD mRNA - containing neurons within the dentate gyrus is selectively vulnerable to seizure - induced damage .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Such differential vulnerability appears to be another indication of the heterogeneity of GABA neurons .

Protective effect of misoprostol on indomethacin induced renal dysfunction in elderly patients .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To evaluate the possible protective effects of misoprostol on renal function in hospitalized elderly patients treated with indomethacin .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O
METHODS :
O O
Forty - five hospitalized elderly patients ( > 65 years old ) who required therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAID ) were randomly assigned to receive either indomethacin ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
150 mg / day ( Group A ) , or indomethacin 150 mg / day plus misoprostol at 0 . 6 mg / day ( Group B ) .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Laboratory variables of renal function [ serum creatinine , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) and electrolytes ] were evaluated before initiation of therapy and every 2 days , until
O O O O O O O B O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
termination of the study ( a period of at least 6 days ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Response to treatment was estimated by the visual analog scale for severity of pain .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Forty - two patients completed the study , 22 in Group A and 20 in Group B . BUN and creatinine increased by > 50 % of baseline levels in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O
54 and 45 % of Group A patients , respectively , compared to only 20 and 10 % of Group B patients ( p < 0 . 05 ) .

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mean increments in BUN , creatinine , and K were reduced by 63 , 80 , and 42 % , respectively , in Group B patients compared to Group
O O O O B O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A . Response to treatment did not differ significantly between the 2 groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Hospitalized elderly patients are at risk for developing indomethacin related renal dysfunction .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Addition of misoprostol can minimize this renal impairment without affecting pain control .

as well as clearance and accumulation experiments after i . v .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
administration of egg - white lysozyme and measurements of inulin clearance ( GFR ) were done in each treatment group .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Gentamicin administration decreased diameter , density and shape of endothelial fenestrae .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
Kanamycin and netilmicin appeared to have no effect at the dose used .
B O B O O O O O O O O O O
All three aminoglycosides decreased GFR and increased urinary excretion of sodium and potassium .
O O B O O O O O O O B O B O
While gentamicin and kanamycin decreased the percentage reabsorption and accumulation of lysozyme after i . v .
O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
administration of egg - white lysozyme netilmicin had no effect .
O O O O O O B O O O O
Daily excretion of total protein , endogenous lysozyme and NAG increased only after treatment with kanamycin and gentamicin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
Thus , aminoglycosides may act as nephrotoxicants at glomerular and / or tubular level inducing impairment of renal reabsorption and accumulation of proteins .

Reversal of ammonia coma in rats by L - dopa : a peripheral effect .
O O B O O O O B I I O O O O O
Ammonia coma was produced in rats within 10 to 15 minutes of an intraperitonealinjection of 1 . 7 mmol NH4CL .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
This coma was prevented with 1 . 68 mmol L - dopa given by gastric intubation 15 minutes before the ammonium salt injection .
O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I O O
The effect of L - dopa was correlated with a decrease in blood and brain ammonia , an increase in brain dopamine , and an increase in renal excretion of
O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
ammonia and urea .
B O B O
Intraventricular infusion of dopamine sufficient to raise the brain dopamine to the same extent did not prevent the ammonia coma nor affect the blood and brain ammonia concentrations .
O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O
Bilateral nephrectomy eliminated the beneficial effect of L - dopa on blood and brain ammonia and the ammonia coma was not prevented .
O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B O O B O O O O O
Thus , the reduction in blood and brain ammonia and the prevention of ammonia coma after L - dopa , can be accounted for by the peripheral effect of
O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
dopamine on renal function rather than its central action .
B O O O O O O O O O
These results provide a reasonable explanation for the beneficial effects observed in some encephalopathic patients receiving L - dopa .

Heparin - induced thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation .
B O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Unfractionated heparin sodium ( UFH ) or low - molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) is used in anticoagulant protocols at several institutions to prevent thrombosis after liver transplantation .
B I I O B O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) is an adverse immune - mediated reaction to heparin , resulting in platelet count decreases of more than 50 % .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
The frequencies of HIT after liver transplantation and platelet factor 4 / heparin - reactive antibody ( HIT antibody ) positivity in liver transplantation patients , however , are unknown
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.

PATIENTS AND METHODS :
O O O O
The 32 men and 20 women underwent living donor liver transplantation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
We started LMWH ( 25 IU / kg / h ) on postoperative day ( POD ) 1 , switching to UFH ( 5000 U / d ) on POD
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
2 or 3 .
O O O O
The dose of UFH was changed according to the activated clotting time level .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
HIT antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on POD 7 and 14 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Platelet count was measured daily for 3 weeks .
O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The average platelet counts preoperatively , and on POD 7 , 14 , and 21 were 65 , 88 , 149 , and 169 x 10 ( 9 ) /
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
L , respectively .
O O O O
Two patients developed hepatic artery thrombosis on POD 11 and 19 , respectively , although they were HIT antibody - negative and their platelet counts were stable .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 2 other patients , the platelet count decreased suddenly from 107 x 10 ( 9 ) / L on POD 4 to 65 x 10 ( 9 ) /
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
L on POD 6 and from 76 x 10 ( 9 ) / L on POD 7 to 33 x 10 ( 9 ) / L on POD 9 ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
respectively .
O O
The heparin - induced platelet aggregation test was negative in these patients .

Force overflow and levodopa - induced dyskinesias in Parkinson 's disease .
O O O B O O O O O O O O
We assessed force coordination of the hand in Parkinson 's disease and its relationship to motor complications of levodopa therapy , particularly to levodopa - induced dyskinesias ( LID )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O
.
O
We studied two groups of Parkinson 's disease patients with ( Parkinson 's disease + LID , n = 23 ) and without levodopa - induced dyskinesias ( Parkinson 's
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
disease - LID , n = 10 ) , and age - matched healthy controls .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The motor score of the Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale , a dyskinesia score and force in a grip - lift paradigm were assessed ON and OFF levodopa .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
A pathological increase of forces was seen in ON - state in Parkinson 's disease + LID only .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In Parkinson 's disease + LID , the force involved in pressing down the object before lifting was significantly increased by levodopa ( by 61 % , P < 0
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
. 05 ) .
O O O O
An overshooting of peak grip force by 51 % ( P < 0 . 05 ) and of static grip force by 45 % ( P < 0 . 01
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) was observed in the ON - compared with the OFF - drug condition .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , no excessive force was found in Parkinson 's disease - LID .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Peak grip force in ON - state was 140 % ( P < 0 . 05 ) higher in Parkinson 's disease + LID than in Parkinson 's disease -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
LID , while static grip force was increased by 138 % ( P < 0 . 01 ) between groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Severity of peak - dose dyskinesias was strongly correlated with grip force in ON - state ( r = 0 . 79 with peak force , P < 0 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
01 ) .
O O O
No correlation was observed between forces and the motor score as well as with the daily dose of dopaminergic medication .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Force excess was only observed in patients with LID and motor fluctuations .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A close relationship was seen between the overshooting of forces and dyskinesias in the ON - drug condition .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We postulate that both LID and grip force excess share common pathophysiological mechanisms related to motor fluctuations .

Clarithromycin - associated visual hallucinations in a patient with chronic renal failure on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Visual hallucinations are a rare event in chronic renal failure and not related to uremia per se .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Unreported in the literature is visual hallucinations occurring in association with the new macrolide antibiotic , clarithromycin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O
We describe such a case in a patient with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) maintained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The combination of a relatively high dose of clarithromycin in face of chronic renal failure in a functionally anephric patient , with underlying aluminum intoxication , may have facilitated the
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
appearance of this neurotoxic side effect .

Acute renal toxicity of doxorubicin ( adriamycin ) - loaded cyanoacrylate nanoparticles .
O O O O B O B O O O B O O
Acute doxorubicin - loaded nanoparticle ( DXNP ) renal toxicity was explored in both normal rats and rats with experimental glomerulonephritis .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In normal rats , 2 / 6 rats given free doxorubicin ( DX ) ( 5 mg / kg ) died within one week , whereas all control animals and
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all rats having received free NP or DXNP survived .
O O O O O O O O O O
A 3 times higher proteinuria appeared in animals treated with DXNP than in those treated with DX .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Free NP did not provoke any proteinuria .
O O O O O O O O
Two hr post - injection , DXNP was 2 . 7 times more concentrated in kidneys than free DX ( p < 0 . 025 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
In rats with immune experimental glomerulonephritis , 5 / 6 rats given DX died within 7 days , in contrast to animals treated by DXNP , NP , or untreated
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, which all survived .
O O O O O
Proteinuria appeared in all series , but was 2 - 5 times more intense ( p > 0 . 001 ) and prolonged after doxorubicin treatment ( 400 - 700
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
mg / day ) , without significant difference between DXNP and DX .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Rats treated by unloaded NP behaved as controls .
O O O O O O O O O
These results demonstrate that , in these experimental conditions , DXNP killed less animals than free DX , despite of an enhanced renal toxicity of the former .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Both effects ( better survival and nephrosis ) are most probably related to an enhanced capture of DXNP by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system , including mesangial cells .

Subjective assessment of sexual dysfunction of patients on long - term administration of digoxin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Various data suggest that male patients who have received digoxin on a longterm basis have increased levels of serum estrogen and decreased levels of plasma testosterone and luteinizing hormone (
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O
LH ) .
O O O
This study was undertaken to investigate the links between the long - term administration of digoxin therapy and sexual behavior , and the effect of digoxin on plasma levels of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
estradiol , testosterone , and LH .
B O B O O O O
The patients of the study and control group ( without digoxin ) were of similar cardiac functional capacity and age ( 25 - 40 years ) and were randomly selected
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
from the rheumatic heart disease patients .
O O O O O O O
A subjective assessment of sexual behavior in the study and control groups was carried out , using parameters such as sexual desire , sexual excitement , and frequency of sexual

relations .
O O
Personal interviews and a questionnaire were also used for the evaluation of sexual behavior .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The findings support the reports concerning digoxin effect on plasma estradiol , testosterone , and LH .
O O O O O O B O O O B O B O O O O
The differences in the means were significant .

Fatal aplastic anemia due to indomethacin - - lymphocyte transformation tests in vitro .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Although indomethacin has been implicated as a possible cause of aplastic anemia on the basis of a few clinical observations , its role has not been definitely established .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A case of fatal aplastic anemia is described in which no drugs other than allopurinol and indomethacin were given .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O
Indomethacin was first given four weeks prior to the onset of symptoms .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O
A positive lymphocyte transformation test with indomethacin in vitro further substantiates the potential role of this drug in causing aplastic anemia in a susceptible patient .

Plasma and urinary lipids and lipoproteins during the development of nephrotic syndrome induced in the rat by puromycin aminonucleoside .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
This study was undertaken to ascertain whether the alterations of plasma lipoproteins found in nephrotic syndrome induced by puromycin aminonucleoside were due to nephrotic syndrome per se , or ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
at least in part , to the aminonucleoside .
O O O O O O O B O
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes in plasma and urinary lipoproteins during the administration of puromycin aminonucleoside ( 20 mg / kg for 7 days
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
) and the subsequent development of nephrotic syndrome .
O O O O O O O O O
Since massive albuminuria occurred after 6 days of treatment , the time - course study was divided into two stages : pre - nephrotic stage
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( day 1 - 5 ) and nephrotic stage ( day 6 - 11 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In pre - nephrotic stage the plasma level of fatty acids , triacylglycerol and VLDL decreased while that of phospholipid , cholesteryl esters and HDL remained constant .
O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
Plasma apolipoprotein A
O O O
- I tended to increase ( 40 % increase at day 5 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At the beginning of nephrotic stage ( day 6 ) the concentration of plasma albumin dropped to a very low level , while that of apolipoprotein A - I increased
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
abruptly ( 4 - fold increase ) and continued to rise , although less steeply , in the following days .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The plasma concentration of HDL followed the same pattern .
O O O O O O O O O O
Plasma VLDL and LDL increased at a later stage ( day 9 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Plasma apolipoprotein A - I was found not only in HDL ( 1 . 063 - 1 . 210 g / ml ) but also in the LDL density class
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( 1 . 025 - 1 . 050 g / ml ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the pre - nephrotic stage lipoproteinuria was negligible , while in the early nephrotic stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of HDL .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These observations indicate that puromycin aminonucleoside alters plasma lipoproteins by lowering VLDL and increasing HDL .
O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
It is likely that the early and striking increase of plasma HDL found in nephrotic rats is related to a direct effect of the drug on HDL metabolism .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Circulating lysosomal enzymes and acute hepatic necrosis .
O O O O O O O O
The activities of the lysosomal enzymes acid and neutral protease , N - acetylglucosaminidase , and acid phosphatase were measured in the serum of patients with fulminant hepatic failure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Acid protease ( cathepsin D ) activity was increased about tenfold in patients who died and nearly fourfold in those who survived fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose , whereas
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
activities were increased equally in patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to viral hepatitis whether or not they survived .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A correlation was found between serum acid protease activity and prothrombin time , and the increase in cathepsin D activity was sustained over several days compared with aspartate aminotransferase ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
which showed a sharp early peak and then a fall .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Circulating lysosomal proteases can damage other organs , and measurement of their activity may therefore be of added value in assessing prognosis in this condition .

Transketolase abnormality in tolazamide - induced Wernicke 's encephalopathy .
O O O B O O O O O O
We studied a thiamine - dependent enzyme , transketolase , from fibroblasts of a diabetic patient who developed Wernicke 's encephalopathy when treated with tolazamide , in order to delineate
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
if this patient also had transketolase abnormality [ high Km for thiamine pyrophosphate ( TPP ) ] , as previously reported in postalcoholic Wernicke - Korsakoff syndrome .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition to this patient , we also studied this enzyme from three diabetic kindreds without any history of Wernicke 's encephalopathy and from four normal controls .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We found that the above - mentioned patient and one of the diabetic kindreds with no history of Wernicke 's encephalopathy had abnormal transketolase as determined by its Km for
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
TPP .
B O
These data suggest a similarity between postalcoholic Wernicke - Korsakoff syndrome and the patient with tolazamide - induced Wernicke 's encephalopathy from the standpoint of transketolase abnormality .

Mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine : comparison with exercise - induced ischemia .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
The role of epinephrine in eliciting myocardial ischemia was examined in patients with coronary artery disease .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Objective signs of ischemia and factors increasing myocardial oxygen consumption were compared during epinephrine infusion and supine bicycle exercise .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O
Both epinephrine and exercise produced myocardial ischemia as evidenced by ST segment depression and angina .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , the mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine were significantly different from those of exercise .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Exercise - induced myocardial ischemia was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate - pressure product with a minor contribution of end - diastolic volume , while epinephrine -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
induced ischemia was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate - pressure product .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings indicate that ischemia produced by epinephrine , as may occur during states of emotional distress , has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion .

Transient contralateral rotation following unilateral substantia nigra lesion reflects susceptibility of the nigrostriatal system to exhaustion by amphetamine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Following unilateral 6 - OHDA induced SN lesion , a transient period of contralateral rotation has been reported to precede the predominant ipsilateral circling .
O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In order to clarify the nature of this initial contralateral rotation we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion , on amphetamine - induced rotational
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
behavior .
O O
Three days post lesion , most rats circled predominantly contralaterally to the lesion .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Such contralateral rotation may result from either degeneration - induced breakdown of the DA pool , or lesion - induced increase of DA turnover in the spared neurons .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when amphetamine was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning , indicating involvement of spared cells in the contralateral
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rotation .
O O
However , regardless of the duration of recovery ( and irrespective of either lesion volume , amphetamine dose , or post - lesion motor exercise ) , amphetamine - induced
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O
rotation tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed , and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further amphetamine injections .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
These findings suggest that amphetamine has an irreversible effect on the post - lesion DA pool contributing to contralateral rotation .

Thyroid function and urine - concentrating ability during lithium treatment .
O O O O O O O O B O O
It has been suggested that adenylate cyclase inhibition may be important in the development of both nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and hypothyroidism during lithium treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
We measured serum thyroxine and urine - concentrating ability ( Umax ) in response to desmopressin ( DDAVP ) in 85 patients receiving lithium .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Hypothyroidism developed in eight patients while they were taking lithium .
O O O O O O O O O B O
Impaired Umax was found in both euthyroid and hypothyroid patients while some hypothyroid patients concentrated their urine well .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is concluded that the dominant mechanisms by which lithium exerts these two effects are different .

Sensitivity of erythroid progenitor colonies to erythropoietin in azidothymidine treated immunodeficient mice .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The anaemia induced by 3' - azido - 3'dideoxythymidine ( AZT ) is poorly understood .
O O O O B I I I I O B O O O O O
We have used a murine model of AIDS , infection of female C57BL / 6 mice with LP - BM5 murine leukaemia ( MuLV ) virus , to determine if
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
AZT - induced anaemia is due , in part , to decreased responsiveness of erythropoietic precursors ( BFU - e ) to erythropoietin ( EPO ) .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mice in the early stage of LP - BM5 MuLV disease were given AZT in their drinking water at 1 . 0 and 2 . 5 mg / ml .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
AZT produced anaemia in both groups , in a dose - dependent fashion .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Despite the anaemia , the number of splenic and bone marrow BFU - e in AZT treated mice increased up to five - fold over levels observed in infected untreated
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
animals after 15 d of treatment .
O O O O O O O
Colony formation by splenic and bone marrow BFUe was stimulated at lower concentrations of EPO in mice receiving AZT for 15 d than for infected , untreated mice .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
By day 30 , sensitivity of both splenic and bone marrow BFU - e of treated animals returned to that observed from cells of infected untreated animals .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mean plasma levels of EPO observed in AZT treated mice were appropriate for the degree of anaemia observed when compared with phenylhydrazine ( PHZ ) treated mice .

The numbers of BFU - e and the percentage of bone marrow erythroblasts observed were comparable in AZT and PHZ treated mice with similar degrees of anaemia .

AZT - induced peripheral anaemia in the face of increased numbers of BFU - e and increased levels of plasma EPO suggest a lesion in terminal differentiation .

Radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine ( MIBG ) , an analog of norepinephrine ( NE ) , serves as an index of adrenergic neuron integrity and function .
B I O B O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Using a rat model of adriamycin - induced cardiomyopathy , we tested the hypothesis that abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear and be exacerbated dose - dependently in
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
adriamycin cardiomyopathy .

The degree of vacuolar degeneration of myocardial cells was analyzed in relation to the duration of adriamycin treatment ( 2 mg / kg , once a week ) .

Myocardial accumulation of [ 125I ] MIBG 4 hr after intravenous injection did not differ between the controls and the groups treated 3 wk or less .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , the 4 - wk group had a slightly lower accumulation in the right ventricular wall ( 82 % of the control ) and significantly lower accumulation in the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
left ventricular wall ( about 66 % of the control : p less than 0 . 05 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the 5 - wk group , MIBG accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 35 % and 27 % of that in controls , respectively ( p
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
less than 0 . 001 ) .
O O O O O O O
In the 8 - wk group , MIBG accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 18 % and 14 % of that in controls , respectively ( p
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
less than 0 . 001 ) .
O O O O O O O
Thus , MIBG accumulation in the myocardium decreased in an adriamycin dose - dependent manner .
O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O
The appearance of impaired cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in the presence of slight myocardial impairment ( scattered or focal vacuolar degeneration ) indicates that MIBG scintigraphy may be a useful

Biphasic response of the SA node of the dog heart in vivo to selective administration of ketamine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Effect of ketamine on the SA node of the dog heart was studied in vivo using a selective perfusion technique of the SA node artery .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Injections of ketamine in doses from 100 microgram to 3 mg into the artery produced a depression of the SA nodal activity by a direct action .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This depression was followed by the sudden appearance of a stimulatory phase .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the ketamine - induced tachycardia , while it was completely abolished in the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
reserpinized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta - blocking agent into the SA node artery .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This may indicate that an activation of the peripheral adrenergic mechanism plays an important role in the induction of the excitatory effect of ketamine injected in the SA node artery

O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Orthostatic hypotension was determined by the average decrease ( % ) in mean arterial pressure ( MAP femoral ) over the 60 - s tilt period .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The basal MAP of conscious SHR was reduced to a similar extent by prazosin ( - 23 % ( - ) - 26 % MAP ) and rauwolscine ( -

MAP in conscious SHR after chronic prazosin treatment was 14 % lower than in the untreated SHR ( n = 8 ) .

22 - oxacalcitriol suppresses secondary hyperparathyroidism without inducing low bone turnover in dogs with renal failure .
B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Calcitriol therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) in patients with renal failure but has several drawbacks , including hypercalcemia and / or marked suppression of bone
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
turnover , which may lead to adynamic bone disease .
O O O O O O O O O O
A new vitamin D analogue , 22 - oxacalcitriol ( OCT ) , has been shown to have promising characteristics .
O O B I O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O
This study was undertaken to determine the effects of OCT on serum PTH levels and bone turnover in states of normal or impaired renal function .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Sixty dogs were either nephrectomized ( Nx , N = 38 ) or sham - operated ( Sham , N = 22 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The animals received supplemental phosphate to enhance PTH secretion .
O O O O B O O O O O
Fourteen weeks after the start of phosphate supplementation , half of the Nx and Sham dogs received doses of OCT ( three times per week ) ; the other half
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
were given vehicle for 60 weeks .
O O O O O O O
Thereafter , the treatment modalities for a subset of animals were crossed over for an additional eight months .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Biochemical and hormonal indices of calcium and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study , and bone biopsies were done at baseline , 60 weeks after OCT or vehicle treatment
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
, and at the end of the crossover period .
O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
In Nx dogs , OCT significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of renal insufficiency .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In long - standing secondary hyperparathyroidism , OCT ( 0 . 03 microg / kg ) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Serum PTH levels rose thereafter , but the rise was less pronounced compared with baseline than the rise seen in Nx control .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These effects were accompanied by episodes of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia .
O O O O O O O O O O O
In animals with normal renal function , OCT induced a transient decrease in serum PTH levels at a dose of 0 . 1 microg / kg , which was not
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sustained with lowering of the doses .
O O O O O O O
In Nx dogs , OCT reversed abnormal bone formation , such as woven osteoid and fibrosis , but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , OCT improved mineralization lag time , ( that is , the rate at which osteoid mineralizes ) in both Nx and Sham dogs .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
These results indicate that even though OCT does not completely prevent the occurrence of hypercalcemia in experimental dogs with renal insufficiency , it may be of use in the management
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of secondary hyperparathyroidism because it does not induce low bone turnover and , therefore , does not increase the risk of adynamic bone disease .

Two phase II trials of 24 - hour paclitaxel infusions in chemotherapy - naive patients with stage IIIB or IV non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) reported
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
response rates of 21 % and 24 % .
O O O O O O O O O
Leukopenia was dose limiting : as many as 62 . 5 % of patients experienced grade 4 leukopenia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We investigated the efficacy and toxicity of a 3 - hour paclitaxel infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The 58 patients treated ( 41 men and 17 women ) had a median age of 59 years ( age range , 25 to 75 ) and a performance status
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of 0 through 2 .
O O O O O
Most patients ( 72 . 4 % ) had stage IV NSCLC .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Paclitaxel 225 mg / m2 was infused over 3 hours every 3 weeks with standard prophylactic premedication .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of 50 patients evaluable for response , 12 ( 24 % ) had partial remission , 26 ( 52 % ) had no change , and 12 had disease progression
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( 24 % ) .
O O O O O
Hematologic toxicities were mild : only one patient ( 2 % ) developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia , while 29 % had grade 1 or 2 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Grade 1 or 2 polyneuropathy affected 56 % of patients while only one ( 2 % ) experienced severe polyneuropathy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Similarly , grade 1 or 2 myalgia / arthralgia was observed in 63 . 2 % of patients , but only 14 . 3 % experienced grade 3 or 4
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Nausea and vomiting were infrequent , with 14 % of patients experiencing grade 1 or 2 and only 2 % experiencing grade 3 or 4 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Paclitaxel is thus an active single agent in this patient population , with a 3 - hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24 - hour infusion and superior in
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
terms of the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O
Further phase II studies with paclitaxel combined with other drugs active against NSCLC are indicated , and phase III studies comparing paclitaxel with standard chemotherapy remain to be completed .

Cerebral hemorrhage associated with phenylpropanolamine in combination with caffeine .
O O O O B O O O B O
Phenylpropanolamine ( PPA ) is a drug that has been associated with serious side effects including stroke .
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is often combined with caffeine in diet preparations and """" look - alike """" pills .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
In order to determine if PPA / caffeine can lead to stroke in normotensive and / or hypertensive rats , we administered the combination in six times the allowed human
O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dose calculated on a per weight basis for the rats two times per day for five days .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Subarachnoid and cerebral hemorrhage was noted in 18 % of the hypertensive rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A single PPA / caffeine administration ( same dose ) lead to acute hypertension in both the normotensive and hypertensive animals .
O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that PPA / caffeine can lead to cerebral hemorrhage in previously hypertensive animals when administered in greater than the allowed dosage .

Long - term efficacy and toxicity of high - dose amiodarone therapy for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Amiodarone was administered to 154 patients who had sustained , symptomatic ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) ( n = 118 ) or a cardiac arrest ( n = 36 )
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and who were refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs .
O O O O O O O O O
The loading dose was 800 mg / day for 6 weeks and the maintenance dose was 600 mg / day .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sixty - nine percent of patients continued treatment with amiodarone and had no recurrence of symptomatic VT or ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) over a follow - up of 6
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to 52 months ( mean + / -
O O O O O O O O

O O O O O O O O
8 . 2 ) .
O O O O O
Six percent of the patients had a nonfatal recurrence of VT and were successfully managed by continuing amiodarone at a higher dose or by the addition of a conventional antiarrhythmic
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
drug .
O O
One or more adverse drug reactions occurred in 51 % of patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Adverse effects forced a reduction in the dose of amiodarone in 41 % and discontinuation of amiodarone in 10 % of patients .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The most common symptomatic adverse reactions were tremor or ataxia ( 35 % ) , nausea and anorexia ( 8 % ) , visual halos or blurring ( 6 %
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) , thyroid function abnormalities ( 6 % ) and pulmonary interstitial infiltrates ( 5 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although large - dose amiodarone is highly effective in the long - term treatment of VT or VF refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs , it causes significant toxicity in approximately
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
50 % of patients .
O O O O O
However , when the dose is adjusted based on clinical response or the development of adverse effects , 75 % of patients with VT or VF can be successfully managed

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
CaCl2 and 4 - aminopyridine .
B O B I I O
Anesthetized rats received the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine IP to produce hypotension , QRS prolongation , and bradycardia .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Fifteen min later , animals received CaCl2 , NaHCO3 , or saline .
O O O O O O B O B O O O O
In a second experiment , rats received tricyclic antidepressant desipramine IP followed in 15 min by 4 - aminopyridine or saline .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I O O O
RESULTS :
O O
NaHCO3 briefly ( 5 min ) reversed hypotension and QRS prolongation .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
CaCl2 and 4 - aminopyridine failed to improve blood pressure .
B O B I I O O O O O O
The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias ( p = 0 . 004 ) and seizures ( p = 0 . 03 ) in the CaCl2 group was higher than the other
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
groups .
O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
The administration of CaCl2 or 4 - aminopyridine did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant - induced hypotension in rats .
O O O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
CaCl2 therapy may possibly worsen both cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings do not support a role for calcium channel inhibition in the pathogenesis of tricyclic antidepressant - induced hypotension .

Phase I trial of 13 - cis - retinoic acid in children with neuroblastoma following bone marrow transplantation .
O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O
PURPOSE :
O O
Treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with 13 - cis - retinoic acid ( cis - RA ) can cause sustained inhibition of proliferation .
O O O O O O B I I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O
Since cis - RA has demonstrated clinical responses in neuroblastoma patients , it may be effective in preventing relapse after cytotoxic therapy .
O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This phase I trial was designed to determine the maximal - tolerated dosage ( MTD ) , toxicities , and pharmacokinetics of cis - RA administered on an intermittent schedule
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O
in children with neuroblastoma following bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
PATIENTS AND METHODS :
O O O O
Fifty - one assessable patients , 2 to 12 years of age , were treated with oral cis - RA administered in two equally divided doses daily for 2 weeks
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
, followed by a 2 - week rest period , for up to 12 courses .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The dose was escalated from 100 to 200 mg / m2 / d until dose - limiting toxicity ( DLT ) was observed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A single intrapatient dose escalation was permitted .
O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The MTD of cis - RA was 160 mg / m2 / d .
O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
Dose - limiting toxicities in six of nine patients at 200 mg / m2 / d included hypercalcemia ( n = 3 ) , rash ( n = 2 )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, and anemia / thrombocytopenia / emesis / rash ( n = 1 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All toxicities resolved after cis - RA was discontinued .
O O O O B I I O O O
Three complete responses were observed in marrow metastases .
O O O O O O O O O
Serum levels of 7 . 4 + / -
O O O O O O O O O
3 . 0 mumol / L ( peak ) and 4 . 0 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 . 8 mumol / L ( trough ) at the MTD were maintained during 14 days of therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The DLT correlated with serum levels > or = 10 mumol / L . CONCLUSION :
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The MTD of cis - RA given on this intermittent schedule was 160 mg / m2 / d .
O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Serum levels known to be effective against neuroblastoma in vitro were achieved at this dose .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The DLT included hypercalcemia , and may be predicted by serum cis - RA levels .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
Monitoring of serum calcium and cis - RA levels is indicated in future trials .

Effect of calcium chloride on gross behavioural changes produced by carbachol and eserine in cats .
O O B I O O O O O O B O B O O O
The effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group - housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization ( rage , hissing and snarling ) , fighting ( attack with
O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
paws and claws , defense with paws and claws and biting ) , mydriasis , tremor and clonic - tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O
.
O
Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
On the other hand , mydriasis , tremor and clonic - tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O B I O
It is apparent that calcium chloride can """" dissociate """" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis , tremor and clonic - tonic convulsions caused by
O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
carbachol and eserine .
B O B O
Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites .
B I O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine - like action also in the central nervous system .

Electrocardiographic changes and cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving psychotropic drugs .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Eight patients had cardiac manifestations that were life - threatening in five while taking psychotropic drugs , either phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressants .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Although most patients were receiving several drugs , Mellaril ( thioridazine ) appeared to be responsible for five cases of ventricular tachycardia , one of which was fatal in a
O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
35 year old woman .
O O O O O
Supraventricular tachycardia developed in one patient receiving Thorazine ( chlorpromazine ) .
O O O O O O O B O B O O
Aventyl ( nortriptyline ) and Elavil ( amitriptyline ) each produced left bundle branch block in a 73 year old woman .
B O B O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Electrocardiographic T and U wave abnormalities were present in most patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The ventricular arrhythmias responded to intravenous administration of lidocaine and to direct current electric shock ; ventricular pacing was required in some instances and intravenous administration of propranolol combined with
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
ventricular pacing in one .
O O O O O
The tachyarrhythmias generally subsided within 48 hours after administration of the drugs was stopped .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Five of the eight patients were 50 years of age or younger ; only one clearly had antecedent heart disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Major cardiac arrhythmias are a potential hazard in patients without heart disease who are receiving customary therapeutic doses of psychotropic drugs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A prospective clinical trial is suggested to quantify the risk of cardiac complications to patients receiving phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressant drugs .

Serotonergic drugs , benzodiazepines and baclofen block muscimol - induced myoclonic jerks in a strain of mice .
O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
In male Swiss mice , muscimol produced myoclonic jerks .
O O O O O B O O O O
A 3 mg / kg ( i . p . )
O O O O O O O O O O O
dose induced this response in all of the mice tested and the peak response of 73 jerks per min was observed between 27 and 45 min .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Increasing the brain serotonin levels by the administration of 5 - hydroxytryptophan ( 80 - 160 mg / kg ) in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor resulted in an
O O O B O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
inhibition of the muscimol effect .
O O O B O O
However , in a similar experiment l - dopa ( 80 - 160 mg / kg ) was without effect .
O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
In doses of 3 - 10 mg / kg , the serotonin receptor agonist MK - 212 caused a dose - dependent blockade of the response of muscimol .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B O
Of the benzodiazepines , clonazepam ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 3 mg / kg ) was found to be several fold more potent than diazepam ( 0 .
O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
3 - 3 mg / kg ) in blocking the myoclonic jerks .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While ( - ) - baclofen ( 1 - 3 mg / kg ) proved to be an effective antagonist of muscimol , its ( + ) - isomer (
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
5 - 20 mg / kg ) lacked this property .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Considering the fact that 5 - HTP and the benzodiazepines have been found to be beneficial in the management of clinical myoclonus , the muscimol - induced myoclonus seems to
O O O O B I I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
be a satisfactory animal model that may prove useful for the development of new drug treatments for this condition .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our present study indicated the possible value of MK - 212 and ( - ) - baclofen in the management of clinical myoclonus .

Hyperglycemic acidotic coma and death in Kearns - Sayre syndrome .
O O O O O O O O O O O
This paper presents the clinical and metabolic findings in two young boys with long - standing Kearns - Sayre syndrome .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Following short exposure to oral prednisone , both boys developed lethargy , increasing somnolence , polydipsia , polyphagia , and polyuria .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both presented in the emergency room with profound coma , hypotension , severe hyperglycemia , and acidosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nonketotic lactic acidosis was present in one and ketosis without a known serum lactate level was present in the other .

Effects of active constituents of Crocus sativus L . , crocin on streptozocin - induced model of sporadic Alzheimer 's disease in male rats .
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
The involvement of water - soluble carotenoids , crocins , as the main and active components of Crocus sativus L . extract in learning and memory processes has been proposed
O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
In the present study , the effect of crocins on sporadic Alzheimer 's disease induced by intracerebroventricular ( icv ) streptozocin ( STZ ) in male rats was investigated .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Male adult Wistar rats ( n = 90 and 260 - 290 g ) were divided into 1 , control ; 2 and 3 , crocins ( 15 and 30
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
mg / kg ) ; 4 , STZ ; 5 and 6 , STZ + crocins ( 15 and 30 mg / kg ) groups .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
In Alzheimer 's disease groups , rats were injected with STZ - icv bilaterally ( 3 mg / kg ) in first day and 3 days later , a similar
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
STZ - icv application was repeated .
B O O O O O O
In STZ + crocin animal groups , crocin was applied in doses of 15 and 30 mg / kg , i . p .
O B O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, one day pre - surgery and continued for three weeks .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Prescription of crocin in each dose was repeated once for two days .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O
However , the learning and memory performance was assessed using passive avoidance paradigm , and for spatial cognition evaluation , Y - maze task was used .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
It was found out that crocin ( 30 mg / kg ) - treated STZ - injected rats show higher correct choices and lower errors in Y - maze than
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
vehicle - treated STZ - injected rats .
O O O B O O O O
In addition , crocin in the mentioned dose could significantly attenuated learning and memory impairment in treated STZ - injected group in passive avoidance test .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Therefore , these results demonstrate the effectiveness of crocin ( 30 mg / kg ) in antagonizing the cognitive deficits caused by STZ - icv in rats and its potential
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer 's disease .

Rosaceiform dermatitis associated with topical tacrolimus treatment .
O O O O O B O O
We describe herein 3 patients who developed rosacea - like dermatitis eruptions while using 0 . 03 % or 0 . 1 % tacrolimus ointment for facial dermatitis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Skin biopsy specimens showed telangiectasia and noncaseating epithelioid granulomatous tissue formation in the papillary to mid dermis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Continuous topical use of immunomodulators such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus should be regarded as a potential cause of rosaceiform dermatitis , although many cases have not been reported .

The toxic effects of tacrine - loaded poly - L - lactid acid nanoparticles ( 5mg / kg ) , a saline solution of tacrine ( 5mg / kg )
O O O O B O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
and an empty colloidal nanoparticle suspension were compared following i . p .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
administration in LiCl - pre - treated Wistar rats .
O O B O O O O O O O
All the animals treated with tacrine - loaded nanoparticles showed an earlier outcome of CNS adverse symptoms , i . e . epileptic onset , with respect to those animals
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
treated with the free compound ( 10 min vs . 22 min respectively ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , tacrine - loaded nanoparticles administration induced damage of neuronal cells in CA1 field of the hippocampus in all treated animals , while the saline solution of
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
tacrine only in 60 % of animals .
B O O O O O O O
Empty nanoparticles provided similar results to control ( saline - treated ) group of animals .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In conclusion , the evaluation of time - to - onset of symptoms and the severity of neurodegenerative processes induced by the tacrine - lithium model of epilepsy in the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
rat , could be used to evaluate preliminarily the capability of a drug delivery system to trespass ( or not ) the BBB in vivo .

The antiarrhythmic effect and possible ionic mechanisms of pilocarpine on animal models .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O
This study was designed to evaluate the effects of pilocarpine and explore the underlying ionic mechanism , using both aconitine - induced rat and ouabain - induced guinea pig arrhythmia
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O
models .
O O
Confocal microscopy was used to measure intracellular free - calcium concentrations ( [ Ca ( 2 + ) ] ( i ) ) in isolated myocytes .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The current data showed that pilocarpine significantly delayed onset of arrhythmias , decreased the time course of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation , reduced arrhythmia score , and increased the survival
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
time of arrhythmic rats and guinea pigs .
O O O O O O O O
[ Ca ( 2 + ) ] ( i ) overload induced by aconitine or ouabain was reduced in isolated myocytes pretreated with pilocarpine .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O B O
Moreover , M ( 3 ) - muscarinic acetylcholine receptor ( mAChR ) antagonist 4 - DAMP ( 4 - diphenylacetoxy - N - methylpiperidine - methiodide ) partially abolished
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I O B I I I I I I I I O O O
the beneficial effects of pilocarpine .
O O O O B O
These data suggest that pilocarpine produced antiarrhythmic actions on arrhythmic rat and guinea pig models induced by aconitine or ouabain via stimulating the cardiac M ( 3 ) - mAChR
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
. The mechanism may be related to the improvement of Ca ( 2 + ) handling .

A 57 - year - old male presented with gradual loss of vision in both eyes with intermittent headaches for 2 months .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He also complained of paraesthesia with numbness in both feet .
O O O O O O O O O O O
His vision was 6 / 15 and 2 / 60 in the right and left eyes , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fundoscopy revealed bilaterally swollen optic nerve heads .

Sustained clinical improvement of a patient with decompensated hepatitis B virus - related cirrhosis after treatment with lamivudine monotherapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection , which causes liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma , remains a major health problem in Asian countries .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recent development of vaccine for prevention is reported to be successful in reducing the size of chronically infected carriers , although the standard medical therapies have not been established up
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to now .
O O O
In this report , we encountered a patient with decompensated HBV - related cirrhosis who exhibited the dramatic improvements after antiviral therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient was a 50 - year - old woman .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Previous conventional medical treatments were not effective for this patient , thus this patient had been referred to our hospital .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , the administration of lamivudine , a reverse transcriptase inhibitor , for 23 months dramatically improved her liver severity .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
During this period , no drug resistant mutant HBV emerged , and the serum HBV - DNA level was continuously suppressed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These virological responses were also maintained even after the antiviral therapy was discontinued .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Moreover , both hepatitis B surface antigen and e antigen were observed to have disappeared in this patient .
O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O
The administration of lamivudine to patients with HBV - related cirrhosis , like our present case , should be considered as an initial medical therapeutic option , especially in countries
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
where liver transplantation is not reliably available .

Dual effects of melatonin on barbiturate - induced narcosis in rats .
O O O B O B O O O O O O
Melatonin affects the circadian sleep / wake cycle , but it is not clear whether it may influence drug - induced narcosis .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sodium thiopenthal was administered intraperitoneally into male rats pre - treated with melatonin ( 0 . 05 , 0 . 5 , 5 and 50 mg / kg ) .
B I O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Melatonin pre - treatment affected in a dual manner barbiturate narcosis , however , no dose - effect correlation was found .
B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
In particular , low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of barbiturate narcosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
In contrast , the highest dose of melatonin ( 50 mg / kg ) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
narcosis , and a reduction in mortality rate .
O O O O O O O O O
Melatonin 0 . 5 and 5 mg / kg influenced the duration but not the latency of ketamine - or diazepam - induced narcosis .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O
Thus , the dual action of melatonin on pharmacological narcosis seems to be specific for the barbiturate mechanism of action .

The effects of NIK - 247 on cholinesterase , scopolamine - induced amnesia and spontaneous movement were examined and compared with those of the well - known cholinesterase inhibitors
O O O B I I O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
tacrine and E - 2020 .
B O B I I O
NIK - 247 , tacrine and E - 2020 all strongly inhibited acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) in human red blood cells ( IC50s = 1 . 0 x 10 (
B I I O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , NIK - 247 and tacrine , but not E - 2020 , strongly inhibited butyrylcholinestrase ( BuChE ) in human serum .
O O O B I I O B O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
All three drugs produced mixed inhibition of AChE activity .
O O O O O O O O O O
Moreover , the inhibitory effect of NIK - 247 on AChE was reversible .

Nightmares and hallucinations after long - term intake of tramadol combined with antidepressants .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Tramadol is a weak opioid with effects on adrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission that is used to treat cancer pain and chronic non malignant pain .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This drug was initiated in association with paroxetine and dosulepine hydrochloride in a tetraparetic patient with chronic pain .
O O O O O O O B O B I O O O O O O O O
Fifty - six days after initiation of the treatment the patient presented hallucinations that only stopped after the withdrawal of psycho - active drugs and tramadol .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The case report questions the long term use of pain killers combined with psycho - active drugs in chronic non malignant pain , especially if pain is under control .

Apparent cure of rheumatoid arthritis by bone marrow transplantation .
O O O O O O O O O O
We describe the induction of sustained remissions and possible cure of severe erosive rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) by bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) in 2 patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BMT was used to treat severe aplastic anemia which was caused by gold in one case and D - penicillamine in the other .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B I I O O O O
In the 8 and 6 years since the transplants ( representing 8 and 4 years since cessation of all immunosuppressive therapy , respectively ) , the RA in each case
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
has been completely quiescent .
O O O O O
Although short term remission of severe RA following BMT has been reported , these are the first cases for which prolonged followup has been available .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This experience raises the question of the role of BMT itself as a therapeutic option for patients with uncontrolled destructive synovitis .

Urinary enzymes and protein patterns as indicators of injury to different regions of the kidney .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Acute experimental models of renal damage to the proximal tubular , glomerular , and papillary regions of the rat were produced by administration of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hexachloro - 1 : 3 - butadiene ( HCBD ) , puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ) , and 2 - bromoethylamine ( BEA ) , respectively .
B I I I I I I O B O O B I O B O O O B I I O B O O O O
Several routine indicators of nephrotoxicity , the enzymes alkaline phosphatase and N - acetyl - beta - glucosaminidase , and the molecular weight of protein excretion were determined on urine
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
samples .
O O
Tubular damage produced by HCBD or BEA was discriminated both quantitatively and qualitatively from glomerular damage produced by PAN .
O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The latter was characterized by a pronounced increase in protein excretion , especially proteins with molecular weight greater than 40 , 000 Da .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , protein excretion in tubular damage was raised only slightly and characterized by excretion of proteins of a wide range of molecular weights .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Proximal tubular damage caused by HCBD and papillary damage caused by BEA were distinguished both by conventional urinalysis ( volume and specific gravity ) and by measurement of the two
O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
urinary enzymes .
O O O
Alkaline phosphatase and glucose were markedly and transiently elevated in proximal tubular damage and N - acetyl - beta - glucosaminidase showed a sustained elevation in papillary damage .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is concluded that both selective urinary enzymes and the molecular weight pattern of urinary proteins can be used to provide diagnostic information about the possible site of renal damage

Neuromuscular blockade with magnesium sulfate and nifedipine .
O O O B I O B O
A patient who received tocolysis with nifedipine developed neuromuscular blockade after 500 mg of magnesium sulfate was administered .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I O O O
This reaction demonstrates that nifedipine can seriously potentiate the toxicity of magnesium .
O O O O B O O O O O O B O
Caution should be exercised when these two tocolytics are combined .

Ifosfamide continuous infusion without mesna .
B O O O B O
A phase I trial of a 14 - day cycle .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Twenty patients received 27 courses of ifosfamide administered as a 24 - hour continuous infusion for 14 days without Mesna .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The goal of the study was to deliver a dose rate and total cumulative dose of ifosfamide that would be comparable to standard bolus or short - term infusions administered
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with Mesna .
O B O
Dose escalations proceeded from 200 to 300 , 400 , 450 , 500 , and 550 mg / m2 / d .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Four patients developed transient microscopic hematuria at 400 , 450 , and 500 mg / m2 / d .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There were no instances of macroscopic hematuria .
O O O O O O O O
At 550 mg / m2 / d , three patients experienced nonurologic toxicity ; confusion ( 1 ) , nausea ( 1 ) , and Grade 2 leukopenia ( 1
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) .
O O
The recommended dose of 500 mg / m2 / d delivers a total dose of 7 g / m2 per cycle , which is comparable to that delivered in clinical
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
practice for bolus or short - term infusion .
O O O O O O O O O
Because few patients received multiple courses over time , the cumulative effects are indeterminate in the present trial .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The frequency and predictability of hematuria are not precise , and at least daily monitoring by urine Hematest is essential , adding Mesna to the infusate in patients with persistent
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
hematuria .
O O
The protracted infusion schedule for ifosfamide permits convenient outpatient administration without Mesna and reduces the drug cost of clinical usage of this agent by up to 890 per cycle .
O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical activity was demonstrated in a single patient , but a comparative trial of standard bolus schedules with the protracted infusion schedule will be necessary to determine if the clinical
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
effectiveness of the drug is maintained .

Myocardial infarction in pregnancy associated with clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction : a case report .
O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Clomiphene citrate ( CC ) is commonly prescribed for ovulation induction .
B I O B O O O O O O O O
It is considered safe , with minimal side effects .
O O O O O O O O O O
Thromboembolism is a rare but life - threatening complication that has been reported after ovulation induction with CC .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Spontaneous coronary thrombosis or thromboembolism with subsequent clot lysis has been suggested as one of the most common causes of myocardial infarction ( MI ) during pregnancy , with a
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
subsequently normal coronary angiogram .
O O O O O
CASE :
O O
A 33 - year - old woman with a 5 - week gestation had recently received CC for ovulation induction and presented with chest pain .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
An electrocardiogram showed a lateral and anterior wall myocardial infarction .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Cardiac enzymes showed a peak rise in troponin I to 9 . 10 ng / mL .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An initial exercise stress test was normal .
O O O O O O O O
At the time of admission , the patient was at high risk of radiation injury to the fetus , so a coronary angiogram was postponed until the second trimester .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It showed normal coronary vessels .
O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
This appears to be the first reported case documenting a possible association between CC and myocardial infarction .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Thrombosis might be a rare but hazardous complication of CC .
O O O O O O O O O B O
Given this life - threatening complication , appropriate prophylactic measures should be used in high - risk woman undergoing ovarian stimulation .

Hepatonecrosis and cholangitis related to long - term phenobarbital therapy : an autopsy report of two patients .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Phenobarbital ( PB ) has a reputation for safety , and it is commonly believed that PB - related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
development of significant chronic liver disease .
O O O O O O O
Here we report of two adult patients with a long history of epilepsy treated with PB who died suddenly : one as consequence of cardiac arrest , the other of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
acute bronchopneumonia .
O O O
At autopsy , analysis of liver parenchyma revealed rich portal inflammatory infiltrate , which consisted of mixed eosinophil and monocyte cells , associated with several foci of necrosis surrounded by
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a hard ring of non - specific granulomatous tissue .
O O O O O O O O O O
Inflammatory reactions of internal and external hepatic biliary ducts were also seen .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our findings illustrate that PB may be associated with chronic liver damage , which may lead to more serious and deleterious consequences .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For this reason , each clinician should recognize this entity in the differential diagnosis of PB - related asymptomatic chronic hepatic enzyme dysfunction .

Ethambutol - associated optic neuropathy .
B O O O O O
INTRODUCTION :
O O
Ethambutol is used in the treatment of tuberculosis , which is still prevalent in Southeast Asia , and can be associated with permanent visual loss .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We report 3 cases which presented with bitemporal hemianopia .
O O O O O O O O O O
CLINICAL PICTURE :
O O O
Three patients with ethambutol - associated toxic optic neuropathy are described .
O O O B O O O O O O O O
All 3 patients had loss of central visual acuity , colour vision ( Ishihara ) and visual field .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The visual field loss had a bitemporal flavour , suggesting involvement of the optic chiasm .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
TREATMENT :
O O
Despite stopping ethambutol on diagnosis , visual function continued to deteriorate for a few months .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Subsequent improvement was mild in 2 cases .
O O O O O O O O
In the third case , visual acuity and colour vision normalised but the optic discs were pale .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
OUTCOME :
O O
All 3 patients had some permanent loss of visual function .
O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Ethambutol usage is associated with permanent visual loss and should be avoided if possible or used with caution and proper ophthalmological follow - up .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The author postulates that in cases of ethambutol associated chiasmopathy , ethambutol may initially affect the optic nerves and subsequently progress to involve the optic chiasm .

Tolerability of nimesulide and paracetamol in patients with NSAID - induced urticaria / angioedema .
O O B O B O O O B O O O O O O
Previous studies evaluated the tolerance of nimesulide and paracetamol in subjects with cutaneous , respiratory and anaphylactoid reactions induced by nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) .
O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B O O
In this study we investigated tolerability and reliability of nimesulide and paracetamol in a very large number of patients with an exclusive well - documented history of NSAID - induced
O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
urticaria / angioedema .
O O O O
Furthermore , we evaluated whether some factors have the potential to increase the risk of reaction to paracetamol and nimesulide .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
A single - placebo - controlled oral challenge procedure with nimesulide or paracetamol was applied to 829 patients with a history of NSAID - induced urticaria / angioedema .
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
A total of 75 / 829 ( 9 . 4 % ) patients experienced reactions to nimesulide or paracetamol .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
Of the 715 patients tested with nimesulide 62 ( 8 . 6 % ) showed a positive test , while of 114 subjects submitted to the challenge with paracetamol ,
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
13 ( 9 . 6 % ) did not tolerate this drug .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , 18 . 28 % of patients with a history of chronic urticaria and 11 . 8 % of subjects with an history of NSAID - induced urticaria /
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
angioedema or angioedema alone ( with or without chronic urticaria ) resulted to be intolerant to alternative drugs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Taken together , our results confirm the good tolerability of nimesulide and paracetamol in patients who experienced urticaria / angioedema caused by NSAIDs .
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O B O
However , the risk of reaction to these alternative study drugs is statistically increased by a history of chronic urticaria and , above all , by a history of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
NSAID - induced angioedema .

Effects of verapamil on atrial fibrillation and its electrophysiological determinants in dogs .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Atrial tachycardia - induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of atrial fibrillation ( AF ) and decreases L - type Ca ( 2 + ) current .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
There is also a clinical suggestion that acute L - type Ca ( 2 ) channel blockade can promote AF , consistent with an AF promoting effect of Ca (
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
2 + ) channel inhibition .
O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
To evaluate the potential mechanisms of AF promotion by Ca ( 2 + ) channel blockers , we administered verapamil to morphine - chloralose anesthetized dogs .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O
Diltiazem was used as a comparison drug and autonomic blockade with atropine and nadolol was applied in some experiments .
B O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O
Epicardial mapping with 240 epicardial electrodes was used to evaluate activation during AF .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Verapamil caused AF promotion in six dogs , increasing mean duration of AF induced by burst pacing , from 8 + / - 4 s ( mean + / -
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
S . E . ) to 95 + / - 39 s ( P < 0 . 01 vs . control ) at a loading dose of 0 . 1
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mg / kg and 228 + / - 101 s ( P < 0 . 0005 vs . control ) at a dose of 0 . 2 mg / kg
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Underlying electrophysiological mechanisms were studied in detail in five additional dogs under control conditions and in the presence of the higher dose of verapamil .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
In these experiments , verapamil shortened mean effective refractory period ( ERP ) from 122 + / - 5 to 114 + / - 4 ms ( P < 0
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
. 02 ) at a cycle length of 300 ms , decreased ERP heterogeneity ( from 15 + / - 1 to 10 + / - 1 % , P
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
< 0 . 05 ) , heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of AF ( 94 + / - 4 to 84 + / - 3 ms
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, P < 0 . 005 ) .
O O O O O O O O
Diltiazem did not affect ERP , AF cycle length or AF duration , but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by verapamil ( n = 5 ) .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
In the presence of autonomic blockade , verapamil failed to promote AF and increased , rather than decreasing , refractoriness .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Neither verapamil nor diltiazem affected atrial conduction in the presence of autonomic blockade .
O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
Epicardial mapping suggested that verapamil promoted AF by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Verapamil promotes AF in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry , an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by diltiazem .

Hypotension , bradycardia , and asystole after high - dose intravenous methylprednisolone in a monitored patient .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
We report a case of hypotension , bradycardia , and asystole after intravenous administration of high - dose methylprednisolone in a 73 - year - old patient who underwent electrocardiographic
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
( ECG ) monitoring throughout the episode .
O O O O O O O O
There was a history of ischemic cardiac disease 9 years earlier .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient was admitted with a pulmonary - renal syndrome with hemoptysis , rapidly progressive renal failure , and hypoxemia that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation , the patient recovered cardiac rhythm .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The ECG showed a junctional rhythm without ventricular arrhythmia .
O O O O O O O O O O
This study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of sudden death after a high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone ( IVMP ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O
These mechanisms are not well understood because , in most cases , the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Rapid infusion and underlying cardiac disease were important risk factors in the case reported here , and the authors discount ventricular arrhythmia as the main mechanism .

Lifetime treatment of mice with azidothymidine ( AZT ) produces myelodysplasia .
O O O O O B O B O O O O
AZT has induced a macrocytic anemia in AIDS patients on long term AZT therapy .
B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
It is generally assumed that DNA elongation is stopped by the insertion of AZT into the chain in place of thymidine thus preventing the phosphate hydroxyl linkages and therefore suppresses
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O
hemopoietic progenitor cell proliferation in an early stage of differentiation .
O O O O O O O O O O O
CBA / Ca male mice started on AZT 0 . 75 mg / ml H2O at 84 days of age and kept on it for 687 days when dosage reduced
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to 0 . 5 mg / ml H2O for a group , another group removed from AZT to see recovery , and third group remained on 0 . 75 mg
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
At 687 days mice that had been on 0 . 75 mg had average platelet counts of 2 . 5 x 10 ( 6 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Histological examination on 9 of 10 mice with such thrombocytopenia showed changes compatible with myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A variety of histological patterns was observed .
O O O O O O O O
There were two cases of hypocellular myelodysplasia , two cases of hypersegmented myelodysplastic granulocytosis , two cases of hypercellular marrow with abnormal megakaryocytes with bizarre nuclei , one case of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
megakaryocytic myelosis associated with a hyperplastic marrow , dysmyelopoiesis and a hypocellular marrow and two cases of myelodysplasia with dyserythropoiesis , hemosiderosis and a hypocellular marrow .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Above mentioned AZT incorporation may have induced an ineffective hemopoiesis in the primitive hemopoietic progenitor cells , which is known to be seen commonly in the myelodysplastic syndrome .

Influence of diet free of NAD - precursors on acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in mice .
O O O O O B O O O B O O O O
Recently , we demonstrated the hepatoprotective effects of nicotinic acid amide , a selective inhibitor of poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ; EC 2 . 4
O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O
. 2 . 30 ) on mice suffering from acetaminophen ( AAP ) - hepatitis , suggesting that the AAP - induced liver injury involves a step which depends on
O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
adenoribosylation .
O O
The present study investigates the effects of a diet free of precursors of NAD , the substrate on which PARP acts , in female NMRI mice with AAP hepatitis and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
evaluates the influence of simultaneous ethanol consumption in these animals .
O O O O O B O O O O O
Liver injuries were quantified as serum activities of glutamate - oxaloacetate transaminase ( GOT ) and glutamate - pyruvate transaminase ( GPT ) .
O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O B O B O O O O O
While AAP caused a 117 - fold elevation of serum transaminase activities in mice kept on a standard laboratory diet , which was significantly exacerbated by ethanol and inhibited by
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
nicotinic acid amide ( NAA ) , adverse effects were noted in animals fed a diet free of precursors of NAD .
B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
In these animals , only minor increases of serum transaminase activities were measured in the presence of AAP , and unlike the exacerbation caused by ethanol in mice on a
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O
standard diet , the liver damage was inhibited by 50 % by ethanol .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
A further 64 % reduction of hepatitis was observed , when NAA was given to ethanol / AAP - mice .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O B O O O
Our results provide evidence that the AAP - induced hepatitis and its exacerbation by ethanol can either be reduced by end - product inhibition of PARP by NAA or by
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
dietary depletion of the enzyme 's substrate NAD .
O O O O O O O B O
We see the main application of NAA as for the combinational use in pharmaceutical preparations of acetaminophen in order to avoid hepatic damage in patients treated with this widely used

Rapid reversal of anticoagulation reduces hemorrhage volume in a mouse model of warfarin - associated intracerebral hemorrhage .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Warfarin - associated intracerebral hemorrhage ( W - ICH ) is a severe type of stroke .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There is no consensus on the optimal treatment for W - ICH .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Using a mouse model , we tested whether the rapid reversal of anticoagulation using human prothrombin complex concentrate ( PCC ) can reduce hemorrhagic blood volume .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O
Male CD - 1 mice were treated with warfarin ( 2 mg / kg over 24 h ) , resulting in a mean ( + / - s . d

. )
O O
International Normalized Ratio of 3 . 5 + / - 0 . 9 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
First , we showed that an intravenous administration of human PCC rapidly reversed anticoagulation in mice .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Second , a stereotactic injection of collagenase was administered to induce hemorrhage in the right striatum .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Forty - five minutes later , the animals were randomly treated with PCC ( 100 U / kg ) or saline i . v .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
( n = 12 per group ) .
O O O O O O O O
Twenty - four hours after hemorrhage induction , hemorrhagic blood volume was quantified using a photometric hemoglobin assay .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mean hemorrhagic blood volume was reduced in PCC - treated animals ( 6 . 5 + / - 3 . 1 microL ) compared with saline controls ( 15
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
. 3 + / - 11 . 2 microL , P = 0 . 015 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the saline group , 45 % of the mice developed large hematomas ( i . e . , > 15 microL ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , such extensive lesions were never found in the PCC group .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
We provide experimental data suggesting PCC to be an effective acute treatment for W - ICH in terms of reducing hemorrhagic blood volume .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Future studies are needed to assess the therapeutic potential emerging from our finding for human W - ICH .

Impact of alcohol exposure after pregnancy recognition on ultrasonographic fetal growth measures .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND : More than 3 decades after Jones and Smith ( 1973 ) reported on the devastation caused by alcohol exposure on fetal development , the rates of heavy drinking
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
during pregnancy remain relatively unchanged .
O O O O O O
Early identification of fetal alcohol exposure and maternal abstinence led to better infant outcomes .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
This study examined the utility of biometry for detecting alcohol - related fetal growth impairment .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
We obtained fetal ultrasound measures from routine ultrasound examinations for 167 pregnant hazardous drinkers who were enrolled in a brief alcohol intervention study .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
The fetal measures for women who quit after learning of their pregnancies were compared with measures for women who continued some drinking throughout the course of their pregnancies .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because intensity of alcohol consumption is associated with poorer fetal outcomes , separate analyses were conducted for the heavy ( average of > or = 5 drinks per drinking day
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) alcohol consumers .
O B O O
Fetal measures from the heavy - exposed fetuses were also compared with measures from a nondrinking group that was representative of normal , uncomplicated pregnancies from our clinics .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Analyses of covariance were used to determine whether there were differences between groups after controlling for influences of gestational age and drug abuse .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Nearly half of the pregnant drinkers abstained after learning of their pregnancies .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When women reportedly quit drinking early in their pregnancies , fetal growth measures were not significantly different from a non - alcohol - exposed group , regardless of prior drinking
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
patterns .
O O
Any alcohol consumption postpregnancy recognition among the heavy drinkers resulted in reduced cerebellar growth as well as decreased cranial to body growth in comparison with women who either quit drinking
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
or who were nondrinkers .
O O O O O
Amphetamine abuse was predictive of larger cranial to body growth ratios .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Alterations in fetal biometric measurements were observed among the heavy drinkers only when they continued drinking after becoming aware of their pregnancies .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although the reliance on self - reported drinking is a limitation in this study , these findings support the benefits of early abstinence and the potential for ultrasound examinations in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the detection of fetal alcohol effects .

Absence of acute cerebral vasoconstriction after cocaine - associated subarachnoid hemorrhage .
O O O O O O B O O O O O
INTRODUCTION :
O O
Cocaine use has been associated with neurovascular complications , including arterial vasoconstriction and vasculitis .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , there are few studies of angiographic effects of cocaine on human cerebral arteries .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Information on these effects could be obtained from angiograms of patients with cocaine - associated subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) who underwent angiography shortly after cocaine use .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
METHODS :
O O
We screened patients with SAH retrospectively and identified those with positive urine toxicology for cocaine or its metabolites .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Quantitative arterial diameter measurements from angiograms of these patients were compared to measurements from control patients with SAH who were matched for factors known to influence arterial diameter .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Qualitative comparisons of small artery changes also were made .
O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Thirteen patients with positive cocaine toxicology were compared to 26 controls .
O O O O B O O O O O O O
There were no significant differences between groups in the mean diameters of the intradural internal carotid , sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral , precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, or basilar arteries ( p greater than 0 . 05 for all comparisons , unpaired t - tests ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There also were no significant differences between groups when expressing diameters as the sum of the precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral + sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral +
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
supraclinoid internal carotid artery + basilar artery divided by the diameter of the petrous internal carotid artery ( p greater than 0 . 05 , unpaired t - tests )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Qualitative assessments showed two arterial irregularities in the distal vasculature in each group .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
No quantitative evidence for narrowing of large cerebral arteries or qualitative angiographic evidence for distal narrowing or vasculitis could be found in patients who underwent angiography after aneurysmal SAH associated
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

following one cycle of doxorubicin - based chemotherapy in the same patient .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias are unusual complications in patients treated with chemotherapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The cardiac toxicity intrinsically associated with the aggressive chemotherapy employed could function as a triggering factor for the arrhythmia in the predisposed myocardium of this patient .

A phase II study of thalidomide in advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVES :
O O
To evaluate the toxicity and activity of thalidomide in patients with advanced metastatic renal cell cancer and to measure changes of one angiogenic factor , vascular endothelial growth factor (
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
VEGF ) 165 , with therapy .
O O O O O O O
PATIENTS AND METHODS :
O O O O
29 patients were enrolled on a study of thalidomide using an intra - patient dose escalation schedule .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Patients began thalidomide at 400 mg / d and escalated as tolerated to 1200 mg / d by day 54 .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fifty - nine per cent of patients had had previous therapy with IL - 2 and 52 % were performance status 2 or 3 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels were measured by dual monoclonal ELISA in 8 patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
24 patients were evaluable for response with one partial response of 11 months duration of a patient with hepatic and pulmonary metastases ( 4 % ) , one minor response
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, and 2 patients stable for over 6 months .
O O O O O O O O O O
Somnolence and constipation were prominent toxicities and most patients could not tolerate the 1200 mg / day dose level .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels did not change with therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
These results are consistent with a low level of activity of thalidomide in renal cell carcinoma .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Administration of doses over 800 mg / day was difficult to achieve in this patient population , however lower doses were practical .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The dose - response relationship , if any , of thalidomide for renal cell carcinoma is unclear .

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
.
O
AIDA in doses of 7 . 5 - 15 microg / 0 . 5 microl diminished the haloperidol - induced muscle rigidity .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
In contrast , 2R , 4R - APDC injections were ineffective .
O O O B I I I I O O O O
The present results may suggest that the blockade of striatal mGluR1 , but not the stimulation of group II mGluRs , may ameliorate parkinsonian muscle rigidity .

Acute cholestatic hepatitis after exposure to isoflurane .
O O O O O O B O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To report a case of acute cholestatic hepatitis following exposure to the inhalational anesthetic isoflurane .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
CASE SUMMARY :
O O O
A 70 - year - old healthy woman from Iraq developed acute cholestatic hepatitis 3 weeks following repair of the right rotator cuff under general anesthesia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was no evidence for viral , autoimmune , or metabolic causes of hepatitis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No other medications were involved except for dipyrone for analgesia .
O O O O O O O B O O O
The alanine aminotransferase was elevated to a peak concentration of 1533 U / L and the serum bilirubin reached a peak of 17 . 0 mg / dL . There
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
was slow improvement over 4 months .
O O O O O O O
Accidental reexposure by the patient to dipyrone was uneventful .
O O O O O O B O O O
DISCUSSION :

Calcitonin gene - related peptide levels during nitric oxide - induced headache in patients with chronic tension - type headache .
O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
It has been proposed that nitric oxide ( NO ) induced headache in primary headaches may be associated with release of calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) .
O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the present study we aimed to investigate plasma levels of CGRP during headache induced by the NO donor glyceryl trinitrate ( GTN ) in 16 patients with chronic tension
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I O B O O O O O O O
- type headache and 16 healthy controls .
O O O O O O O O
The subjects were randomly allocated to receive 0 . 5 microg / kg / min GTN or placebo over 20 min on two headache - free days .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Blood samples were collected at baseline , 10 , 20 and 60 min after start of infusion .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both patients and controls developed significantly stronger immediate headache on the GTN day than on the placebo day and the headache was significantly more pronounced in patients than in controls
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
There was no difference between the area under the CGRP curve ( AUCCGRP ) on GTN vs . placebo day in either patients ( P = 0 . 65 )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
or controls ( P = 0 . 48 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O
The AUCCGRP recorded on the GTN day did not differ between patients and controls ( P = 0 . 36 ) .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both in patients and controls , CGRP levels changed significantly over time , on both the GTN and placebo days ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
The present study indicates that NO - induced immediate headache is not associated with release of CGRP .

Myocardial ischemia due to coronary artery spasm during dobutamine stress echocardiography .
O O O O O O O O B O O O
Dobutamine stress echocardiography ( DSE ) is a useful and safe provocation test for myocardial ischemia .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Until now , the test has been focused only on the organic lesion in the coronary artery , and positive DSE has indicated the presence of significant fixed coronary artery
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
stenosis .
O O
The aim of the present study is to examine whether myocardial ischemia due to coronary spasm is induced by dobutamine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
We performed DSE on 51 patients with coronary spastic angina but without significant fixed coronary artery stenosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All patients had anginal attacks at rest with ST elevation on the electrocardiogram ( variant angina ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Coronary spasm was induced by intracoronary injection of acetylcholine , and no fixed coronary artery stenosis was documented on angiograms in all patients .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DSE was performed with intravenous dobutamine infusion with an incremental doses of 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , and 40 microg / kg / min every 5 minutes
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Of the 51 patients , 7 patients showed asynergy with ST elevation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All 7 patients ( 13 . 7 % ) had chest pain during asynergy , and both chest pain and electrocardiographic changes were preceded by asynergy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings indicate that dobutamine can provoke coronary spasm in some patients with coronary spastic angina .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
When DSE is performed to evaluate coronary artery disease , not only fixed coronary stenosis , but also coronary spasm should be considered as a genesis of asynergy .

Nitric oxide synthase expression in the course of lead - induced hypertension .
B I O O O O O O B O O O O
We recently showed elevated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , reduced urinary excretion of NO metabolites ( NOx ) , and increased NO sequestration as nitrotyrosine in various tissues
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O B O O O
in rats with lead - induced hypertension .
O O O B O O O O
This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary NOx in lead - induced hypertension is , in part , due to depressed NO synthase ( NOS )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
expression .
O O
Male Sprague - Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a lead - treated group ( given lead acetate , 100 ppm , in drinking water and regular rat chow )
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
, a group given lead and vitamin E - fortified chow , or a normal control group given either regular food and water or vitamin E - fortified food for
O O O O B O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
12 weeks .
O O O
Tail blood pressure , urinary NOx excretion , plasma malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , and endothelial and inducible NOS ( eNOS and iNOS ) isotypes in the aorta and kidney
O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
were measured .
O O O
The lead - treated group exhibited a rise in blood pressure and plasma MDA concentration , a fall in urinary NOx excretion , and a paradoxical rise in vascular and
O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
renal tissue eNOS and iNOS expression .
O O O O O O O
Vitamin E supplementation ameliorated hypertension , lowered plasma MDA concentration , and raised urinary NOx excretion while significantly lowering vascular , but not renal , tissue eNOS and iNOS expression
B I O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Vitamin E supplementation had no effect on either blood pressure , plasma MDA , or NOS expression in the control group .
B I O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
The study also revealed significant inhibition of NOS enzymatic activity by lead in cell - free preparations .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
In conclusion , lead - induced hypertension in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eNOS and iNOS expression .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is , in part , due to ROS - mediated NO inactivation , lead - associated inhibition of NOS activity , and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
associated with hypertension .

PATIENTS : 46 patients who used fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for 14 days or more and had echocardiograms obtained before therapy .
O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
MEASUREMENTS : Follow - up echocardiography .
O O O O O O O
The primary outcome was new or worsening valvulopathy , defined as progression of either aortic or mitral regurgitation by at least one degree of severity and disease that met U

Carboplatin toxic effects on the peripheral nervous system of the rat .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
The most striking of carboplatin 's advantages ( CBDCA ) over cisplatin ( CDDP ) is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effects .
O O O O B O O O B O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
However , the use of CBDCA higher - intensity schedules and the association with other neurotoxic drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to peripheral
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nervous system damage .
O O O O
MATERIALS AND METHODS :
O O O O
Two different schedules of CBDCA administration ( 10 mg / kg and 15 mg / kg i . p .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
twice a week for nine times ) were evaluated in Wistar rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Neurotoxicity was assessed for behavioral ( tail - flick test ) , neurophysiological ( nerve conduction velocity in the tail nerve ) , morphological , morphometrical and analytical effects .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
CBDCA administration induced dose - dependent peripheral neurotoxicity .
B O O O O O O O O
Pain perception and nerve conduction velocity in the tail were significantly impaired , particularly after the high - dose treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and , to a lesser extent , satellite cells showed the same changes as those induced by CDDP , mainly affecting the nucleus and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
nucleolus of ganglionic sensory neurons .
O O O O O O
Moreover , significant amounts of platinum were detected in the dorsal root ganglia and kidney after CBDCA treatment .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
CBDCA is neurotoxic in our model , and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by CDDP that it is probable that neurotoxicity
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism .
O O O O O O O O O O O
This model can be used alone or in combination with other drugs to explore the effect of CBDCA on the peripheral nervous system .

Since tamoxifen is widely used in breast cancer treatment and has been proposed for the prevention of breast cancer , its endometrial iatrogenic effects must be carefully examined .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have investigated the association between endometrial cancer and tamoxifen use or other treatments in women treated for breast cancer in a case - control study .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed after breast cancer ( n = 135 ) and 467 controls matched for age , year of diagnosis of breast cancer and hospital and survival
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
time with an intact uterus were included .
O O O O O O O O
Women who had received tamoxifen were significantly more likely to have endometrial cancer diagnosed than those who had not ( crude relative risk = 4 . 9 , p =
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
0 . 0001 ) .
O O O O O
Univariate and adjusted analyses showed that the risk increased with the length of treatment ( p = 0 . 0001 ) or the cumulative dose of tamoxifen received ( p
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
= 0 . 0001 ) , irrespective of the daily dose .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Women who had undergone pelvic radiotherapy also had a higher risk ( crude relative risk = 7 . 8 , p = 0 . 0001 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After adjusting for confounding factors , the risk was higher for tamoxifen users ( p = 0 . 0012 ) , treatment for more than 3 years ( all p
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
< 0 . 03 ) and pelvic radiotherapy ( p = 0 . 012 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Women who had endometrial cancer and had received tamoxifen had more advanced disease and poorer prognosis than those with endometrial cancer who had not received this treatment .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our results suggest a causal role of tamoxifen in endometrial cancer , particularly when used as currently proposed for breast cancer prevention .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pelvic radiotherapy may be an additional iatrogenic factor for women with breast cancer .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Endometrial cancers diagnosed in women treated with tamoxifen have poorer prognosis .
O O O O O O O B O O O O
Women who receive tamoxifen for breast cancer should be offered gynaecological surveillance during and after treatment .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A long - term evaluation of the risk - benefit ratio of tamoxifen as a preventive treatment for breast cancer is clearly warranted .

Granulosa cell tumor of the ovary associated with antecedent tamoxifen use .
O O O O O O O O O B O O
BACKGROUND : Increased attention has been focused recently on the estrogenic effects of tamoxifen .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Review of the literature reveals an association between tamoxifen use and gynecologic tumors .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
CASE :
O O
A 52 - year - old postmenopausal woman was treated with tamoxifen for stage II estrogen receptor - positive breast carcinoma .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O
Her aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels increase markedly after 6 months of tamoxifen use .
O B O O B O O O O O O O O B O O
After an additional 17 months of elevated serum transaminases , the patient was found to have a stage Ic granulosa cell tumor of the ovary .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Patients with tamoxifen - induced liver dysfunction may be at increased risk for granulosa cell tumors because of alterations in tamoxifen metabolism .

A murine model of adenomyosis : the effects of hyperprolactinemia induced by fluoxetine hydrochloride , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , on adenomyosis induction in Wistar albino rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE : The aim of this study was to investigate whether fluoxetine given to castrated and noncastrated rats caused hyperprolactinemia and its effects with respect to adenomyosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DESIGN :
O O
Fluoxetine , a serotonin reuptake inhibitor , was given to Wistar Albino rats for 98 days to produce hyperprolactinemia .
B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The drug was given to two groups consisting of castrated and noncastrated rats and compared to two groups of castrated and noncastrated controls .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Prolactin levels were measured and the uteri of the rats were removed for histopathological analysis at the end of 98 days .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
SETTING :
O O
Marmara University School of Medicine , Department of Histology and Embryology , Zeynep Kamil Women and Children 's Hospital .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES :
O O O O
Serum prolactin levels , uterine histopathology .
O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The prolactin levels of castrated and noncastrated groups treated with fluoxetine were statistically significantly higher when compared to their respective control groups .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Histological studies revealed 11 cases of adenomyosis , all within the noncastrated group receiving fluoxetine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
CONCLUSION :
O O
It was suggested that high serum prolactin levels cause degeneration of myometrial cells in the presence of ovarian steroids that results in a myometrial invasion by endometrial stroma .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
This invasion eventually progresses to adenomyosis .

Effects of deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane on neuropsychological function .
O O O O O O B O B O O O O
The effect of deliberate hypotension on brain function measured by neuropsychological tests was studied in 41 adult patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Twenty - four patients were anaesthetized for middle - ear surgery with deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane ( hypotensive group ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
Seventeen patients without hypotension served as a control group .
O O O O O O O O O O
The mean arterial pressure was 77 + / -
O O O O O O O O O
2 mmHg ( 10 . 3 + / -
O O O O O O O O O
0 . 3 kPa ) before hypotension and 50
O O O O O O O O O
+ / - 0
O O O O
mmHg ( 6 . 7 + / - 0 . 0 kPa ) during hypotension in the hypotensive group , and 86 + / - 2 mmHg ( 11 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 + / - 0 . 3 kPa ) during anaesthesia in the control group .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The following psychological tests were performed : four subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale ( similarities , digit span , vocabulary and digit symbol ) , Trail - Making
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
tests A and B , Zung tests ( self - rating anxiety scale and self - rating depression scale ) and two - part memory test battery with immediate and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
delayed recall .
O O O
The tests were performed preoperatively and 2 days postoperatively .
O O O O O O O O O O
There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the tests in the changes from preoperative value to postoperative value .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results indicate that hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane has no significant harmful effects on mental functions compared to normotensive anaesthesia .

Auditory disturbance associated with interscalene brachial plexus block .
O O O O O O O O O
We performed an audiometric study in 20 patients who underwent surgery of the shoulder region under an interscalene brachial plexus block ( IBPB ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bupivacaine 0 . 75 % with adrenaline was given followed by a 24 - hr continuous infusion of 0 . 25 % bupivacaine .
B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Three audiometric threshold measurements ( 0 . 25 - 18 kHz ) were made : the first before IBPB , the second 2 - 6 h after surgery and the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
third on the first day after operation .
O O O O O O O O
In four patients hearing impairment on the side of the block was demonstrated after operation , in three measurements on the day of surgery and in one on the following
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
day .
O O
The frequencies at which the impairment occurred varied between patients ; in one only low frequencies ( 0 . 25 - 0 . 5 kHz ) were involved .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The maximum change in threshold was 35 dB at 6 kHz measured at the end of the continuous infusion of bupivacaine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
This patient had hearing threshold changes ( 15 - 20 dB ) at 6 - 10 kHz on the opposite side also .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
IBPB may cause transient auditory dysfunction in the ipsilateral ear , possibly via an effect on sympathetic innervation .

Midazolam compared with thiopentone as an induction agent .
B O O B O O O O O
In patients premedicated with scopolamine + morphine ( + 5 mg nitrazepam the evening before surgery ) , the sleep - inducing effect of midazolam 0 . 15 mg /
O O O O B O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
kg i . v .
O O O O O
was clearly slower in onset than that of thiopentone 4 . 67 mg / kg i . v .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Somewhat fewer cardiovascular and local sequelae were found in the midazolam group , but , although apnoea occurred less often in the midazolam group it lasted longer .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
On the whole , the differences between midazolam and thiopentone had no apparent clinical consequences .
O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O
Midazolam is a new alternative agent for induction in combination anaesthesia .

Cardiotoxic and possible leukemogenic effects of adriamycin in nonhuman primates .
O O O O O O B O O O O
10 monkeys ( macaques ) received adriamycin by monthly intravenous injections at 12 mg / m2 ( 1 mg / kg ) .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8 of the 10 monkeys developed congestive heart failure at an average cumulative adriamycin dose ( 310 mg / m2 ) well below that considered the safe upper limit (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
550 mg / m2 ) in man .
O O O O O O O O
Histologically , the myocardial lesions resembled those found in human anthracycline - induced cardiomyopathy .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
1 of the 10 monkeys developed acute myeloblastic leukemia after receiving 324 mg / m2 of adriamycin ; the 10th monkey is alive and well 26 months after the last
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dose of drug .
O O O O
Our results suggest that adriamycin is a more potent cardiotoxin in monkeys than in man , and that leukemia may be a consequence of prolonged treatment with this drug .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Doxorubicin cardiomyopathy in children with left - sided Wilms tumor .
B O O O O O O O O O O
Two children with Wilms tumor of the left kidney experienced severe anthracycline cardiomyopathy after irradiation to the tumor bed and conventional dosage of doxorubicin .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The cardiomyopathy is attributed 1 ) to the fact that radiation fields for left Wilms tumor include the lower portion of the heart and 2 ) to the interaction of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
doxorubicin and irradiation on cardiac muscle .
B O O O O O O
It is recommended that doxorubicin dosage be sharply restricted in children with Wilms tumor of the left kidney who receive postoperative irradiation .

Promotional effects of testosterone and dietary fat on prostate carcinogenesis in genetically susceptible rats .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Germfree ( GF )
O O O O
Lobund strain Wistar ( LW ) rats , fed vegetable diet L - 485 , have developed prostate adenocarcinomas spontaneously ( 10 % incidence ) at average age 34 months
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Conventional LW rats , implanted with testosterone at age 4 months , developed a higher incidence of prostate cancer after an average interval of 14 months : 24 % had
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
developed gross tumors , and 40 % when it included microscopic tumors .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Preliminary results indicate that testosterone - treated LW rats that were fed the same diet , which was supplemented with corn oil up to 20 % fat , developed prostate
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cancer after intervals of 6 - 12 months .
O O O O O O O O O
Aged GF Sprague - Dawley ( SD ) rats have not developed prostate cancer spontaneously .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Conventional SD rats fed diet L - 485 and treated with testosterone developed only prostatitis .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Experimental designs should consider genetic susceptibility as a basic prerequisite for studies on experimental prostate cancer .

Mitomycin C associated hemolytic uremic syndrome .
B I O O O O O
Mitomycin C associated Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome ( HUS ) is a potentially fatal but uncommon condition that is not yet widely recognised .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It consists of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia , thrombocytopenia and progressive renal failure associated with mitomycin C treatment and affects about 10 % of patients treated with this agent .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The renal failure usually develops about 8 - 10 mth after start of mitomycin C treatment and the mortality is approximately 60 % from renal failure or pulmonary edema .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Renal lesions are similar to those seen in idiopathic HUS and include arteriolar fibrin thrombi , expanded subendothelial zones in glomerular capillary walls , ischemic wrinkling of glomerular basement membranes
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and mesangiolysis .
O O O
The mechanism of action is postulated as mitomycin C - induced endothelial cell damage .
O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
We describe the clinical course and pathological findings in a 65 yr - old man with gastric adenocarcinoma who developed renal failure and thrombocytopenia while on treatment with

Continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring during fluorouracil therapy : a prospective study .
O O O O O B O O O O O O
Although there have been anecdotal reports of cardiac toxicity associated with fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) therapy , this phenomenon has not been studied in a systematic fashion .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We prospectively performed continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring on 25 patients undergoing 5 - FU infusion for treatment of solid tumors in order to assess the incidence of ischemic ST changes
O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Patients were monitored for 23 + / -
O O O O O O O O
4 hours before 5 - FU infusion , and 98 + / -
O O O B I I O O O O O O O
9 hours during 5 - FU infusion .
O O O B I I O O
Anginal episodes were rare : only one patient had angina ( during 5 - FU infusion ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O
However , asymptomatic ST changes ( greater than or equal to 1 mm ST deviation ) were common : six of 25 patients ( 24 % ) had ST changes
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
before 5 - FU infusion v 17 ( 68 % ) during 5 - FU infusion ( P less than . 002 ) .
O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
The incidence of ischemic episodes per patient per hour was 0 . 05 + / -

prior to 5 - FU infusion v 0 . 13 + / - 0 . 03 during 5 - FU infusion ( P less than . 001 ) ; the

duration of ECG changes was 0 . 6 + / - 0 . 3 minutes per patient per hour before 5 - FU v 1 . 9 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
0 . 5 minutes per patient per hour during 5 - FU ( P less than . 01 ) .
O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
ECG changes were more common among patients with known coronary artery disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There were two cases of sudden death , both of which occurred at the end of the chemotherapy course .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We conclude that 5 - FU infusion is associated with a significant increase in silent ST segment deviation suggestive of ischemia , particularly among patients with coronary artery disease .
O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mechanism and clinical significance of these ECG changes remain to be determined .

Lethal anuria complicating high dose ifosfamide chemotherapy in a breast cancer patient with an impaired renal function .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
A sixty - year - old woman with advanced breast cancer , previously treated with cisplatin , developed an irreversible lethal renal failure with anuria , the day after 5
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
g / m2 bolus ifosfamide .
O O O O B O
Postrenal failure was excluded by echography .
O O O O O O O
A prerenal component could have contributed to renal failure because of a transient hypotension , due to an increasing ascitis , occurring just before anuria .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , correction of the hemodynamic parameters did not improve renal function .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ifosfamide is a known nephrotoxic drug with demonstrated tubulopathies .
B O O O O O O O O O
We strongly suspect that this lethal anuria was mainly due to ifosfamide , occurring in a patient having received previous cisplatin chemotherapy and with poor kidney perfusion due to transient
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
hypotension .
O O
We recommend careful use of ifosfamide in patients pretreated with nephrotoxic chemotherapy and inadequate renal perfusion .

The beta adrenergic blocking drug , timolol , tended to correct the hypokalemia of short - term bendrofluazide treatment in 6 healthy male subjects and although the effect was small
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was significant .
O O O O
Timolol also reduced the rise in plasma aldosterone and urine potassium excretion following bendrofluazide and increased the urine sodium / potassium ratio .

Serum testosterone concentration increased with pubertal status but was not affected by hyperprolactinemia .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
As expected , bone mineral content and BMD increased with sexual maturity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After adjusting for the stage of sexual development and height and BMI z scores , serum prolactin was negatively associated with trabecular volumetric BMD at the ultradistal radius ( P
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
< . 03 ) .
O O O O O
Controlling for relevant covariates , we also found treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) to be associated with lower trabecular BMD at the radius ( P =
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
. 03 ) and BMD z score at the lumbar spine ( P < . 05 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings became more marked when the analysis was restricted to non - Hispanic white patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of 13 documented fractures , 3 occurred after risperidone and SSRIs were started , and none occurred in patients with hyperprolactinemia .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
This is the first study to link risperidone - induced hyperprolactinemia and SSRI treatment to lower BMD in children and adolescents .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Future research should evaluate the longitudinal course of this adverse event to determine its temporal stability and whether a higher fracture rate ensues .

Seizures associated with levofloxacin : case presentation and literature review .
O O O B O O O O O O O
PURPOSE :
O O
We present a case of a patient who developed seizures shortly after initiating treatment with levofloxacin and to discuss the potential drug - drug interactions related to the inhibition of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cytochrome P450 ( CYP )
O O O O O
1A2 in this case , as well as in other cases , of levofloxacin - induced seizures .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Several biomedical databases were searched including MEDLINE , Cochrane and Ovid .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The main search terms utilized were case report and levofloxacin .
O O O O O O O O O B O
The search was limited to studies published in English .
O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Six cases of levofloxacin - induced seizures have been reported in the literature .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Drug - drug interactions related to the inhibition of CYP1A2 by levofloxacin are likely involved in the clinical outcome of these cases .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Clinicians are exhorted to pay close attention when initiating levofloxacin therapy in patients taking medications with epileptogenic properties that are CYP1A2 substrates .

Mice lacking mPGES - 1 are resistant to lithium - induced polyuria .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Cyclooxygenase - 2 activity is required for the development of lithium - induced polyuria .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
However , the involvement of a specific , terminal prostaglandin ( PG ) isomerase has not been evaluated .
O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O
The present study was undertaken to assess lithium - induced polyuria in mice deficient in microsomal prostaglandin E synthase - 1 ( mPGES - 1 ) .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O
A 2 - wk administration of LiCl ( 4 mmol . kg ( - 1 ) . day ( - 1 ) ip ) in mPGES - 1 + /
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
+ mice led to a marked polyuria with hyposmotic urine .
O O O O O O O O O O O
This was associated with elevated renal mPGES - 1 protein expression and increased urine PGE ( 2 ) excretion .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O
In contrast , mPGES - 1 - / - mice were largely resistant to lithium - induced polyuria and a urine concentrating defect , accompanied by nearly complete blockade of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
high urine PGE ( 2 ) and cAMP output .
O O B I I I O O O O
Immunoblotting , immunohistochemistry , and quantitative ( q ) RT - PCR consistently detected a significant decrease in aquaporin - 2 ( AQP2 ) protein expression in both the renal
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cortex and medulla of lithium - treated + / + mice .
O O O O B O O O O O O O
This decrease was significantly attenuated in the - / - mice . qRT - PCR detected similar patterns of changes in AQP2 mRNA in the medulla but not in the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cortex .
O O
Similarly , the total protein abundance of the Na - K - 2Cl cotransporter ( NKCC2 ) in the medulla but not in the cortex of the + / +
O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mice was significantly reduced by lithium treatment .
O O O O O B O O
In contrast , the dowregulation of renal medullary NKCC2 expression was significantly attenuated in the - / - mice .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We conclude that mPGES - 1 - derived PGE ( 2 ) mediates lithium - induced polyuria likely via inhibition of AQP2 and NKCC2 expression .

Identification of a simple and sensitive microplate method for the detection of oversulfated chondroitin sulfate in heparin products .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O
Heparin is a commonly implemented anticoagulant used to treat critically ill patients .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recently , a number of commercial lots of heparin products were found to be contaminated with an oversulfated chondroitin sulfate ( OSCS ) derivative that could elicit a hypotensive response
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
in pigs following a single high - dose infusion .
O O O O O O O O O O
Using both contaminated heparin products and the synthetically produced derivative , we showed that the OSCS produces dose - dependent hypotension in pigs .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The no observed effect level ( NOEL ) for this contaminant appears to be approximately 1mg / kg , corresponding to a contamination level of approximately 3 % .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We also demonstrated that OSCS can be identified in heparin products using a simple , inexpensive , commercially available heparin enzyme immunoassay ( EIA ) kit that has a limit
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
of detection of approximately 0 . 1 % , well below the NOEL .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This kit may provide a useful method to test heparin products for contamination with oversulfated GAG derivatives .

Doxorubicin cardiomyopathy - induced inflammation and apoptosis are attenuated by gene deletion of the kinin B1 receptor .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical use of the anthracycline doxorubicin ( DOX ) is limited by its cardiotoxic effects , which are attributed to the induction of apoptosis .
O O O O B B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To elucidate the possible role of the kinin B1 receptor ( B1R ) during the development of DOX cardiomyopathy , we studied B1R knockout mice ( B1R ( - /
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
- ) ) by investigating cardiac inflammation and apoptosis after induction of DOX - induced cardiomyopathy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
DOX control mice showed cardiac dysfunction measured by pressure - volume loops in vivo .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This was associated with a reduced activation state of AKT , as well as an increased bax / bcl2 ratio in Western blots , indicating cardiac apoptosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 were increased in the cardiac tissue .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In DOX B1R ( - / - ) mice , cardiac dysfunction was improved compared to DOX control mice , which was associated with normalization of the bax / bcl
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- 2 ratio and interleukin 6 , as well as AKT activation state .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings suggest that B1R is detrimental in DOX cardiomyopathy in that it mediates the inflammatory response and apoptosis .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
These insights might have useful implications for future studies utilizing B1R antagonists for treatment of human DOX cardiomyopathy .

Hepatotoxicity associated with sulfasalazine in inflammatory arthritis :
O O O B O O O O
A case series from a local surveillance of serious adverse events .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Spontaneous reporting systems for adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) are handicapped by under - reporting and limited detail on individual cases .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We report an investigation from a local surveillance for serious adverse drug reactions associated with disease modifying anti - rheumatic drugs that was triggered by the occurrence of liver failure
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in two of our patients .
O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Serious ADR reports have been solicited from local clinicians by regular postcards over the past seven years .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients ' , who had hepatotoxicity on sulfasalazine and met a definition of a serious ADR , were identified .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two clinicians reviewed structured case reports and assessed causality by consensus and by using a causality assessment instrument .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The likely frequency of hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated by making a series of conservative assumptions .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Ten cases were identified : eight occurred during surveillance .
O O O O O O O O O O
Eight patients were hospitalised , two in hepatic failure - one died after a liver transplant .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All but one event occurred within 6 weeks of treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Seven patients had a skin rash , three eosinophilia and one interstitial nephritis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Five patients were of Black British of African or Caribbean descent .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Liver enzymes showed a hepatocellular pattern in four cases and a mixed pattern in six .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Drug - related hepatotoxicity was judged probable or highly probable in 8 patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The likely frequency of serious hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated at 0 . 4 % of treated patients .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Serious hepatotoxicity associated with sulfasalazine appears to be under - appreciated and intensive monitoring and vigilance in the first 6 weeks of treatment is especially important .

An evaluation of amikacin nephrotoxicity in the hematology / oncology population .
O O O B O O O O O O O O
Amikacin is an aminoglycoside commonly used to provide empirical double gram - negative treatment for febrile neutropenia and other suspected infections .
B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Strategies of extended - interval and conventional dosing have been utilized extensively in the general medical population ; however , data are lacking to support a dosing strategy in the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hematology / oncology population .
O O O O O
To evaluate amikacin - associated nephrotoxicity in an adult hematology / oncology population , a prospective , randomized , open - label trial was conducted at a university - affiliated
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
medical center .
O O O
Forty patients with a diagnosis consistent with a hematologic / oncologic disorder that required treatment with an aminoglycoside were randomized to either conventional or extended - interval amikacin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O
The occurrence of nephrotoxicity by means of an increase in serum creatinine and evaluation of efficacy via amikacin serum concentrations with respective pathogens were assessed .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the conventional and extended - interval groups , at 10 % and 5 % , respectively ( P = 1 . 00 )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Six patients in the conventional group had a positive culture , compared with none in the extended - interval group ( P = 0 . 002 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the two dosing regimens , but the distribution of risk factors was variable between the two groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Efficacy could not be assessed .

Memory function and serotonin transporter promoter gene polymorphism in ecstasy ( MDMA ) users .
O O O B O O O O O B O B O O O
Although 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA or ecstasy ) has been shown to damage brain serotonin ( 5 - HT ) neurons in animals and possibly humans ,
O B I I I I O B O B O O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O O O O
little is known about the long - term consequences of MDMA - induced 5 - HT neurotoxic lesions on functions in which 5 - HT is involved , such as
O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O
cognitive function .
O O O
Because 5 - HT transporters play a key element in the regulation of synaptic 5 - HT transmission it may be important to control for the potential covariance effect of
O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a polymorphism in the 5 - HT transporter promoter gene region ( 5 - HTTLPR ) when studying the effects of MDMA as well as cognitive functioning .
O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of moderate and heavy MDMA use on cognitive function , as well as the effects of long - term abstention
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
from MDMA , in subjects genotyped for 5 - HTTLPR .
O B O O O O O O O O O
A second aim of the study was to determine whether these effects differ for females and males .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fifteen moderate MDMA users ( < 55 lifetime tablets ) , 22 heavy MDMA + users ( > 55 lifetime tablets ) , 16 ex - MDMA + users (
O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
last tablet > 1 year ago ) and 13 controls were compared on a battery of neuropsychological tests .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DNA from peripheral nuclear blood cells was genotyped for 5 - HTTLPR using standard polymerase chain reaction methods .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A significant group effect was observed only on memory function tasks ( p = 0 . 04 ) but not on reaction times ( p = 0 . 61 )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
or attention / executive functioning ( p = 0 . 59 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Heavy and ex - MDMA + users performed significantly poorer on memory tasks than controls .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , no evidence of memory impairment was observed in moderate MDMA users .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
No significant effect of 5 - HTTLPR or gender was observed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
While the use of MDMA in quantities that may be considered """" moderate """" is not associated with impaired memory functioning , heavy use of MDMA use may lead to
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
long lasting memory impairments .
O O O O O
No effect of 5 - HTTLPR or gender on memory function or MDMA use was observed .

Aging process of epithelial cells of the rat prostate lateral lobe in experimental hyperprolactinemia induced by haloperidol .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The aim of the study was to examine the influence of hyperprolactinemia , induced by haloperidol ( HAL ) on age related morphology and function changes of epithelial cells in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
rat prostate lateral lobe .
O O O O O
The study was performed on sexually mature male rats .
O O O O O O O O O O
Serum concentrations of prolactin ( PRL ) and testosterone ( T ) were measured .
O O O O O B O O B O B O O O O
Tissue sections were evaluated with light and electron microscopy .
O O O O O O O O O O
Immunohistochemical reactions for Anti - Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen ( PCNA ) were performed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In rats of the experimental group , the mean concentration of : PRL was more than twice higher , whereas T concentration was almost twice lower than that in the
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
control group .
O O O
Light microscopy visualized the following : hypertrophy and epithelium hyperplasia of the glandular ducts , associated with increased PCNA expression .

Does supplemental vitamin C increase cardiovascular disease risk in women with diabetes ?
O O B I O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Vitamin C acts as a potent antioxidant ; however , it can also be a prooxidant and glycate protein under certain circumstances in vitro .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of vitamin C in diabetic persons might promote atherosclerosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE : The objective was to examine the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from cardiovascular disease .
O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
DESIGN :
O O
We studied the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from total cardiovascular disease ( n = 281 ) , coronary artery disease ( n = 175 ) , and
O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
stroke ( n = 57 ) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being diabetic at baseline .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Diet was assessed with a food - frequency questionnaire at baseline , and subjects initially free of coronary artery disease were prospectively followed for 15 y . RESULTS :
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors , type of diabetes medication used , duration of diabetes , and intakes of folate , vitamin E , and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I O O
beta - carotene , the adjusted relative risks of total cardiovascular disease mortality were 1 . 0 , 0 . 97 , 1 . 11 , 1 . 47 ,
B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and 1 . 84
O O O O
( P for trend < 0 . 01 ) across quintiles of total vitamin C intake from food and supplements .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
Adjusted relative risks of coronary artery disease were 1 . 0 , 0 . 81 , 0 . 99 , 1 . 26 , and 1 . 91 ( P
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for trend = 0 . 01 ) and of stroke were 1 . 0 , 0 . 52 , 1 . 23 , 2 . 22 , and 2 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
57 ( P for trend < 0 . 01 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O
When dietary and supplemental vitamin C were analyzed separately , only supplemental vitamin C showed a positive association with mortality endpoints .
O O O O B I O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
Vitamin C intake was unrelated to mortality from cardiovascular disease in the nondiabetic subjects at baseline .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
A high vitamin C intake from supplements is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality in postmenopausal women with diabetes .

Absolute and attributable risk of venous thromboembolism in women on combined cyproterone acetate and ethinylestradiol .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To achieve absolute risk estimates of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) among women on cyproterone acetate plus ethinylestradiol ( CPA / EE ) , and among women on
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O B O B O O O O O O
combined oral contraceptives ( COCs ) .
B I I O B O O
METHODS :
O O
From the Danish National Register of Patients ( NRP ) , 1996 to 1998 , the records of 1 . 1 million Danish women , ages 15 to 44 years
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, were searched for evidence of VTE .
O O O O O O O O
COC use was ascertained through mailed questionnaires .
B O O O O O O O
Sales statistics of COCs and CPA / EE were provided through Danish Drug Statistics .
O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
During the time frame of the study , 330 women were found to have had VTE while on COCs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Of these women , 67 were on levonorgestrel - containing COCs .
O O O O O O O B O O B O
Eleven were on CPA / EE .
O O O B O B O
The corresponding absolute risk of VTE was 3 . 4 ( range , 3 . 1 - 3 . 8 ) per 10 000 women years among the women on
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
COCs , 4 . 2 ( range , 3 . 2 - 5 . 2 ) per 10 000 women years among women on levonorgestrel - containing COCs , and
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O
3 . 1 ( range , 1 . 3 - 4 . 9 ) per 10 000 women years among the women on CPA / EE .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Our results suggest the absolute risk of VTE among Danish women on COCs is similar to that among women taking CPA / EE .

Effect of lindane on hepatic and brain cytochrome P450s and influence of P450 modulation in lindane induced neurotoxicity .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Oral administration of lindane ( 2 . 5 , 5 , 10 and 15 mg / kg , body weight ) for 5 days was found to produce a dose
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- dependent increase in the activity of P450 dependent 7 - ethoxyresorufin - O - deethylase ( EROD ) , 7 - pentoxyresorufin - O - dealkylase ( PROD )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and N - nitrosodimethylamine demethylase ( NDMA - d ) in rat brain and liver .
O B I I O O B O O O O O O O O O
A significant increase in the hepatic and brain P450 monooxygenases was also observed when the duration of exposure of low dose ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lindane was increased from 5 days to 15 or 21 days .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
As observed with different doses , the magnitude of induction in the activity of P450 monooxygenases was several fold higher in liver microsomes when compared with the brain .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Western blotting studies have indicated that the increase in the P450 enzymes could be due to the increase in the expression of P450 1A1 / 1A2 , 2B1 / 2B2
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and 2E1 isoenzymes .
O O O O
In vitro studies using organic inhibitors specific for individual P450 isoenzymes and antibody inhibition experiments have further demonstrated that the increase in the activity of PROD , EROD and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
NDMA - d are due to the increase in the levels of P450 2B1 / 2B2 , 1A1 / 1A2 and 2E1 isoenzymes , respectively .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Induction studies have further shown that while pretreatment of 3 - methylcholanthrene ( MC ) , an inducer of P4501A1 / 1A2 , did not produce any significant effect in
O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the incidence of lindane induced convulsions , pretreatment with phenobarbital ( PB ) , an inducer of P450 2B1 / 2B2 or ethanol , an inducer of P450 2E1 catalysed
O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
reactions , significantly increased the incidence of lindane induced convulsions .
O O O O O O O B O O O
Similarly , when the P450 - mediated metabolism of lindane was blocked by cobalt chloride incidence of convulsions was increased in animals treated with lindane indicating that lindane per se
O O O O O O O O O B O O O B I O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O
or its metabolites formed by PB or ethanol inducible P450 isoenzymes are involved in its neurobehavioral toxicity .

After 5 weeks of bupropion use , the subject experienced a generalized tonic clonic seizure after staying up nearly all night packing and moving to a new residence .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient had no other risk factors for seizures .
O O O O O O O O O O
We suggest that sleep deprivation may add to the risk of bupropion - associated seizures .

Nephrotoxic effects in high - risk patients undergoing angiography .
O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
The use of iodinated contrast medium can result in nephropathy .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Whether iso - osmolar contrast medium is less nephrotoxic than low - osmolar contrast medium in high - risk patients is uncertain .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
We conducted a randomized , double - blind , prospective , multicenter study comparing the nephrotoxic effects of an iso - osmolar , dimeric , nonionic contrast medium ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
iodixanol , with those of a low - osmolar , nonionic , monomeric contrast medium , iohexol .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The study involved 129 patients with diabetes with serum creatinine concentrations of 1 . 5 to 3 . 5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The primary end point was the peak increase from base line in the creatinine concentration during the three days after angiography .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Other end points were an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0 . 5 mg per deciliter or more , an increase of 1 . 0 mg per deciliter or
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
more , and a change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The creatinine concentration increased significantly less in patients who received iodixanol .
O B O O O O O O O O B O
From day 0 to day 3 , the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0 . 13 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0 . 55 mg per
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
deciliter in the iohexol group ( P = 0 . 001 ; the increase with iodixanol minus the increase with iohexol , - 0 . 42 mg per deciliter [
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
95 percent confidence interval , - 0 . 73 to - 0 . 22 ] ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two of the 64 patients in the iodixanol group ( 3 percent ) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0 . 5 mg per deciliter or more ,
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the iohexol group ( 26 percent ) ( P = 0 . 002 ; odds ratio for such an increase in
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the iodixanol group , 0 . 09
O B O O O O O
[ 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 02 to 0 . 41 ] ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No patient receiving iodixanol had an increase of 1 . 0 mg per deciliter or more , but 10 patients in the iohexol group ( 15 percent ) did .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0 . 07 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0 . 24 mg per
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
deciliter in the iohexol group ( P = 0 . 003 ; value in the iodixanol group minus the value in the iohexol group , - 0 . 17 mg
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
per deciliter [ 95 percent confidence interval , - 0 . 34 to - 0 . 07 ] ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Nephropathy induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high - risk patients when iodixanol is used rather than a low - osmolar , nonionic contrast medium

Experimental cranial pain elicited by capsaicin : a PET study .
O O O O O B O O O O O
Using a positron emission tomography ( PET ) study it was shown recently that in migraine without aura certain areas in the brain stem were activated during the headache state
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, but not in the headache free interval .
O O O O O O O O O
It was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the migraine attack itself and represents the so called ' migraine generator ' .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To test this hypothesis we performed an experimental pain study in seven healthy volunteers , using the same positioning in the PET scanner as in the migraine patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A small amount of capsaicin was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Increases of regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) were found bilaterally in the insula , in the anterior cingulate cortex , the cavernous sinus and the cerebellum .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned migraine study no brain stem activation was found in the acute pain state compared to the pain free state
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
The increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however , suggests that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted pain as such ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rather than in a specific type of headache as was suggested for cluster headache .

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome with risperidone .
O O O O B O
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is thought to be a result of dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the striatum of the basal ganglia .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Risperidone , a benzisoxazole derivative antipsychotic , has high serotonin 5 - HT2 receptor blockade and dose - related D2 receptor blockade .
B O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone at low dosages .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
With this low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms , it was thought the frequency of neuroleptic malignant syndrome might also be lowered .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 73 - year - old woman developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome after monotherapy with risperidone .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The syndrome reversed after discontinuing risperidone and starting treatment with dantrolene and bromocriptine .
O O O O O B O O O O B O B O
It appears that the protection from extrapyramidal side effects observed with risperidone does not ensure protection from neuroleptic malignant syndrome .

Hepatic and extrahepatic angiotensinogen gene expression in rats with acute nephrotic syndrome .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Plasma concentration and urine excretion of the renin - angiotensin system proteins are altered in rats with nephrotic syndrome ( NS ) .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this work the messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) levels of angiotensinogen ( Ao ) were analyzed with the slot - blot hybridization technique in liver and other extrahepatic
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
tissues : kidney , heart , brain , and adrenal gland from control , nephrotic , and pair - fed ( PF ) rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
NS was induced by a single injection of puromycin amino - nucleoside ( PAN ) .
O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O O
Although a great urinary excretion and half - normal plasma levels of Ao were observed on day 6 after PAN injection , when NS was clearly established , hepatic Ao
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
mRNA levels did not change .
O O O O O O
Furthermore , the Ao mRNA levels did not change in any of the extrahepatic tissues studied on day 6 , nor did its hepatic levels at days 1 , 3
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, 5 , or 7 after PAN injection .
O O O O O O B O O
These data suggest that the hepatic and extrahepatic Ao mRNA levels are unaltered during the development of the acute NS induced by PAN .

Cyclophosphamide associated bladder cancer - - a highly aggressive disease : analysis of 12 cases .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PURPOSE :
O O
We gained knowledge of the etiology , treatment and prevention of cyclophosphamide associated urothelial cancer .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
MATERIALS AND METHODS :
O O O O
The medical records of 6 men and 6 women ( mean age 55 years ) with cyclophosphamide associated bladder cancer were reviewed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
All tumors were grade 3 or 4 transitional cell carcinoma .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Of the 5 patients initially treated with endoscopic resection alone only 1 is alive without disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of the 6 patients who underwent early cystectomy 4 were alive at 24 to 111 months .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The remaining patient with extensive cancer underwent partial cystectomy for palliation and died 3 months later .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Cyclophosphamide associated bladder tumor is an aggressive disease .
B O O O O O O O O
However , long - term survival is possible when radical cystectomy is performed for bladder tumors with any sign of invasion and for recurrent high grade disease , even when
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
noninvasive .

Leg and back pain after spinal anaesthesia involving hyperbaric 5 % lignocaine .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Fifty - four patients , aged 27 - 90 years , who were given lignocaine 5 % in 6 . 8 % glucose solution for spinal anaesthesia were studied .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Thirteen of these patients experienced pain in the legs and / or back after recovery from anaesthesia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patients affected were younger ( p < 0 . 05 ) and the site of the dural puncture was higher ( p < 0 . 01 ) than those
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
individuals without pain .
O O O O
Five of the 13 patients ( 38 % ) with pain and seven of the 41 patients ( 17 % ) without pain admitted to a high alcohol intake ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
which might be a contributing factor .

Acute blood pressure elevations with caffeine in men with borderline systemic hypertension .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Whether the vasoconstrictive actions of caffeine are enhanced in hypertensive persons has not been demonstrated .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , caffeine ( 3 . 3 mg / kg ) versus placebo was tested in 48 healthy men ( aged 20 to 35 years ) selected after screening on
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 separate occasions .
O O O O
Borderline hypertensive men ( n = 24 ) were selected with screening systolic blood pressure ( BP ) of 140 to 160 mm Hg and / or diastolic BP 90
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to 99 mm Hg .
O O O O O
Low - risk controls ( n = 24 ) reported no parental history of hypertension and had screening BP < 130 / 85 mm Hg .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Participants were then tested on 2 occasions after 12 - hour abstinence from caffeine in each of 2 protocols ; this required a total of 4 laboratory visits .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Caffeine - induced changes in diastolic BP were 2 to 3 times larger in borderline subjects than in controls ( + 8 . 4 vs + 3 . 8 mm
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hg , p < 0 . 0001 ) , and were attributable to larger changes in impedance - derived measures of systemic vascular resistance ( + 135 vs + 45
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dynes . s . cm - 5 , p < 0 . 004 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings were consistent and reached significance in both protocols .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The percentage of borderline subjects in whom diastolic BP changes exceeded the median control response was 96 % .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Consequently , whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline , 33 % of borderline subjects achieved hypertensive BP levels after caffeine ingestion .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Thus , in borderline hypertensive men , exaggerated responses to caffeine were : selective for diastolic BP , consistent with greater vasoconstriction , replicated in 2 protocols , and representative
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of nearly all borderline hypertensives .
O O O O O O
We suspect that the potential for caffeine to stabilize high resistance states in susceptible persons suggests that its use may facilitate their disease progression , as well as hinder accurate

diagnosis and treatment .

Hallucinations and ifosfamide - induced neurotoxicity .
O O B O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Hallucinations as a symptom of central neurotoxicity are a known but poorly described side effect of ifosfamide .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Most cases of ifosfamide - induced hallucinations have been reported with other mental status changes .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
The authors interviewed six persons with ifosfamide - induced hallucinations in the presence of a clear sensorium .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
All patients were receiving high - dose ifosfamide as part of their bone marrow transplant procedure .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Hallucinations occurred only when the patient 's eyes were closed and , in all but one case , were reported as disturbing or frightening .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Underreporting of these hallucinations by patients is likely .
O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Hallucinations may be the sole or first manifestation of neurotoxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The incidence may be dose and infusion - time related .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The clinician should be alerted for possible ifosfamide - induced hallucinations , which may occur without other signs of neurotoxicity .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"""" Eyes - closed """" hallucinatory experiences appear to be an unusual feature of this presentation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients anxious about this experience respond well to support and education about this occurrence .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Optimal pharmacologic management of disturbed patients is unclear .
O O O O O O O O O
If agitation becomes marked , high - potency neuroleptics ( i . e . , haloperidol ) may be effective .

Factors associated with nephrotoxicity and clinical outcome in patients receiving amikacin .
O O O O O O O O O O B O
Data from 60 patients treated with amikacin were analyzed for factors associated with nephrotoxicity .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
In 42 of these patients , data were examined for factors associated with clinical outcome .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Variables evaluated included patient weight , age , sex , serum creatinine level , creatinine clearance , duration of therapy , total dose , mean daily dose , organism minimum
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) , mean peak levels , mean trough levels , mean
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
area under the serum concentration - time curve ( AUC ) , total AUC , mean AUC greater than MIC , total AUC greater than MIC , mean Schumacher 's
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
intensity factor ( IF ) , total IF , In ( mean maximum concentration [ Cmax ] / MIC ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Model - dependent pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by computer based on a one - compartment model .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When the parameters were examined individually , duration of therapy and total AUC correlated significantly ( P less than . 05 ) with nephrotoxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , a stepwise discriminant function analysis identified only duration of therapy ( P less than . 001 ) as an important factor .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Based on this model and on Bayes ' theorem , the predictive accuracy of identifying """" nephrotoxic """" patients increased from 0 . 17 to 0 . 39 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When examined individually , mean IF , MIC , total dose , mean daily dose , and ln ( mean Cmax / MIC ) correlated significantly ( P less than
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
. 05 ) with cure .
O O O O O O
In contrast , a simultaneous multivariable analysis identified IF , MIC , and total dose according to one model and ln ( mean Cmax / MIC ) according to a
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
second statistical model of parameters selected to have the greatest prospective value .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Based on Bayes ' theorem and the first model , the predictive accuracy of identifying patients not cured increased from 0 . 19 to 0 . 83 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For the second model , the predictive accuracy increased from 0 . 19 to 0 . 50 . ( ABSTRACT

Cardiac transplantation : improved quality of survival with a modified immunosuppressive protocol .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The effects on renal function on two different immunosuppressive protocols were evaluated retrospectively in two subsequent groups of heart transplant recipients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In group I , cyclosporine was given before the procedure at a loading dose of 17 . 5 mg / kg and then continued after the procedure to keep a
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
whole blood level about 1000 ng / ml .
O O O O O O O O O
In group II , cyclosporine was started only after the procedure at a lower dosage and was complemented by azathioprine , which was used for the first postoperative week .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Group II showed a better perioperative renal function as determined by serum blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B O O
Group II also showed a significant decrease of chronic nephrotoxicity secondary to long - term therapy with cyclosporine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Despite this improvement in late renal function , group II still shows a slow rise in serum creatinine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
We think that even these lower dosages of cyclosporine can cause chronic nephrotoxicity and that further modification of the immunosuppressive regimen is required to completely abolish this toxic side effect

Reversible cholestasis with bile duct injury following azathioprine therapy .
O O O O O O O B O O
A case report .
O O O O
A 67 - year - old patient , with primary polymyositis and without previous evidence of liver disease , developed clinical and biochemical features of severe cholestasis 3 months after
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
initiation of azathioprine therapy .
O O B O O
Liver biopsy showed cholestasis with both cytological and architectural alterations of interlobular bile ducts .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Azathioprine withdrawal resulted after 7 weeks in the resolution of clinical and biochemical abnormalities .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is believed that this is the first reported case of reversible azathioprine - induced cholestasis associated with histological evidence of bile duct injury .

Renal function and hemodynamics during prolonged isoflurane - induced hypotension in humans .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The effect of isoflurane - induced hypotension on glomerular function and renal blood flow was investigated in 20 human subjects .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) and effective renal plasma flow ( ERPF ) were measured by inulin and para - aminohippurate ( PAH ) clearance , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O
Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl , nitrous oxide , oxygen , and isoflurane .
O O O O B O B I O B O O B O
Hypotension was induced for 236 . 9 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O
15 . 1 min by increasing the isoflurane inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59 . 8 + / -
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
0 . 4 mmHg .
O O O O O
GFR and ERPF decreased with the induction of anesthesia but not significantly more during hypotension .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Postoperatively , ERPF returned to preoperative values , whereas GFR was higher than preoperative values .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Renal vascular resistance increased during anesthesia but decreased when hypotension was induced , allowing the maintenance of renal blood flow .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We conclude that renal compensatory mechanisms are preserved during isoflurane - induced hypotension and that renal function and hemodynamics quickly return to normal when normotension is resumed .

Debrisoquine phenotype and the pharmacokinetics and beta - 2 receptor pharmacodynamics of metoprolol and its enantiomers .
B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The metabolism of the cardioselective beta - blocker metoprolol is under genetic control of the debrisoquine / sparteine type .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O B O O
The two metabolic phenotypes , extensive ( EM ) and poor metabolizers ( PM ) , show different stereoselective metabolism , resulting in apparently higher beta - 1 adrenoceptor antagonistic
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
potency of racemic metoprolol in EMs .
O O O B O O O
We investigated if the latter also applies to the beta - 2 adrenoceptor antagonism by metoprolol .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The drug effect studied was the antagonism by metoprolol of terbutaline - induced hypokalemia .
O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O
By using pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling the pharmacodynamics of racemic metoprolol and the active S - isomer , were quantitated in EMs and PMs in terms of IC50 values , representing
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
metoprolol plasma concentrations resulting in half - maximum receptor occupancy .
B O O O O O O O O O O
Six EMs received 0 . 5 mg of terbutaline s . c .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O
on two different occasions : 1 ) 1 hr after administration of a placebo and 2 ) 1 hr after 150 mg of metoprolol p . o .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Five PMs were studied according to the same protocol , except for a higher terbutaline dose ( 0 . 75 mg ) on day 2 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Blood samples for the analysis of plasma potassium , terbutaline , metoprolol ( racemic , R - and S - isomer ) , and alpha - hydroxymetoprolol concentrations were taken
O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O
at regular time intervals , during 8 hr after metoprolol .

Cefotetan - induced immune hemolytic anemia .
B O O O O O O
Immune hemolytic anemia due to a drug - adsorption mechanism has been described primarily in patients receiving penicillins and first - generation cephalosporins .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O
We describe a patient who developed anemia while receiving intravenous cefotetan .
O O O O O O O O O O B O
Cefotetan - dependent antibodies were detected in the patient 's serum and in an eluate prepared from his red blood cells .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The eluate also reacted weakly with red blood cells in the absence of cefotetan , suggesting the concomitant formation of warm - reactive autoantibodies .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
These observations , in conjunction with clinical and laboratory evidence of extravascular hemolysis , are consistent with drug - induced hemolytic anemia , possibly involving both drug - adsorption and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
autoantibody formation mechanisms .
O O O O
This case emphasizes the need for increased awareness of hemolytic reactions to all cephalosporins .

Acute renal failure subsequent to the administration of rifampicin .
O O O O O O O O B O
A follow - up study of cases reported earlier .
O O O O O O O O O O
A clinical presentation is made of a 2 - 3 year follow - up of six cases of acute renal failure that have been reported earlier .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patients had developed transient renal failure after the intermittent administration of rifampicin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The stage of olig - anuria lasted for 1 - 3 weeks , and five of the patients were treated by hemodialysis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two of the patients died due to unrelated causes during the follow - up period .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The four patients re - examined were clinically cured .
O O O O O O O O O O
Pathologic findings by light microscopy and immunofluorescence at biopsy were scarce .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nothing abnormal was seen by electron microscopy in two of the cases studied .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Renal function was normal .
O O O O O
In three cases the excretion at 131I - hippuran renography was slightly slowed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although in the acute stage the renal lesions histologically appeared toxic , evidence suggestive of an immunological mechanism can not be excluded .

Type B hepatitis after needle - stick exposure : prevention with hepatitis B immune globulin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Final report of the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study .
O O O O O O O O O
Hepatitis B immune globulin ( HBIG ) and immune serum globulin ( ISG ) were examined in a randomized , double - blind trial to assess their relative efficacies in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
preventing type B hepatitis after needle - stick exposure to hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAG ) - positive donors .
O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O O O O O
Clinical hepatitis developed in 1 . 4 % of HBIG and in 5 . 9 % of ISG recipients ( P = 0 . 016 ) , and seroconversion (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anti - HBs ) occurred in 5 . 6 % and 20 . 7 % of them respectively ( P less than 0 . 001 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mild and transient side - effects were noted in 3 . 0 % of ISG and in 3 . 2 % of HBIG recipients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Available donor sera were examined for DNA polymerase ( DNAP ) and e antigen and antibody ( HBeAg ; anti - HBE ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Both DNAP and HBeAg showed a highly statistically significant correlation with the infectivity of HBsAg - positive donors .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Hepatitis B immune globulin remained significantly superior to ISG in preventing type B hepatitis even when the analysis was confined to these two high - risk subgroups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The efficacy of ISG in preventing type B hepatitis can not be ascertained because a true placebo group was not included .

Serotonin syndrome from venlafaxine - tranylcypromine interaction .
O O O B O B O O
Excessive stimulation of serotonin 5HT1A receptors causes a syndrome of serotonin excess that consists of shivering , muscle rigidity , salivation , confusion , agitation and hyperthermia .
O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The most common cause of this syndrome is an interaction between a monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) and a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Venlafaxine is a new antidepressant agent that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine .
B O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
We report a venlafaxine - MAOI interaction that resulted in the serotonin syndrome in a 23 - y - old male who was taking tranylcypromine for depression .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
He had been well until the morning of presentation when he took 1 / 2 tab of venlafaxine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Within 2 h he became confused with jerking movements of his extremities , tremors and rigidity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was brought directly to a hospital where he was found to be agitated and confused with shivering , myoclonic jerks , rigidity , salivation and diaphoresis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
His pupils were 7 mm and sluggishly reactive to light .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Vital signs were : blood pressure 120 / 67 mm Hg , heart rate 127 / min , respiratory rate 28 / min , and temperature 97 F .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After 180 mg of diazepam i . v .
O O O O B O O O O
he remained tremulous with muscle rigidity and clenched jaws .
O O O O O O O O O O
He was intubated for airway protection and because of hypoventilation , and was paralyzed to control muscle rigidity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
His subsequent course was remarkable for non - immune thrombocytopenia which resolved .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient 's maximal temperature was 101 . 2 F and his CPK remained < 500 units / L with no other evidence of rhabdomyolysis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
His mental status normalized and he was transferred to a psychiatry ward .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This patient survived without sequelae due to the aggressive sedation and neuromuscular paralysis .

Effect of nondopaminergic drugs on L - dopa - induced dyskinesias in MPTP - treated monkeys .
O O O O O B I I O O O O B O O O O
A group of four monkeys was rendered parkinsonian with the toxin MPTP .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O
They were then treated chronically with L - DOPA / benserazide 50 / 12 . 5 mg / kg given orally daily for 2 months .
O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This dose produced a striking antiparkinsonian effect , but all animals manifested dyskinesia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A series of agents acting primarily on neurotransmitters other than dopamine were then tested in combination with L - DOPA to see if the dyskinetic movements would be modified .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
Several drugs , including clonidine , physostigmine , methysergide , 5 - MDOT , propranolol , and MK - 801 , markedly reduced the dyskinetic movements but at the cost
O O O O B O B O B O B I I O B O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
of a return of parkinsonian symptomatology .
O O O O O O O
However , yohimbine and meperidine reduced predominantly the dyskinetic movements .
O O B O B O O O O O O
Baclofen was also useful in one monkey against a more dystonic form of dyskinesia .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Atropine converted the dystonic movements into chorea .

CCNU ( lomustine ) toxicity in dogs : a retrospective study ( 2002 - 07 ) .
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To describe the incidence of haematological , renal , hepatic and gastrointestinal toxicities in tumour - bearing dogs receiving
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 - ( 2 - chloroethyl ) - 3 - cyclohexyl - 1 - nitrosourea ( CCNU ) .
B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I O B O O
DESIGN :
O O
The medical records of 206 dogs that were treated with CCNU at the Melbourne Veterinary Specialist Centre between February 2002 and December 2007 were retrospectively evaluated .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Of the 206 dogs treated with CCNU , 185 met the inclusion criteria for at least one class of toxicity .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CCNU was used most commonly in the treatment of lymphoma , mast cell tumour , brain tumour , histiocytic tumours and epitheliotropic lymphoma .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Throughout treatment , 56 . 9 % of dogs experienced neutropenia , 34 . 2 % experienced anaemia and 14 . 2 % experienced thrombocytopenia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Gastrointestinal toxicosis was detected in 37 . 8 % of dogs , the most common sign of which was vomiting ( 24 . 3 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Potential renal toxicity and elevated alanine transaminase ( ALT ) concentration were reported in 12 . 2 % and 48 . 8 % of dogs , respectively .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The incidence of hepatic failure was 1 . 2 % .
O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
CCNU - associated toxicity in dogs is common , but is usually not life threatening .

Neuroactive steroids protect against pilocarpine - and kainic acid - induced limbic seizures and status epilepticus in mice .
O B O O B O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
Several structurally related metabolites of progesterone ( 3 alpha - hydroxy pregnane - 20 - ones ) and deoxycorticosterone (
O O O O O B O B I I I I I I I I O O B O
3 alpha - hydroxy pregnane - 21 - diol - 20 - ones ) and their 3 beta - epimers were evaluated for protective activity against pilocarpine - ,
B I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
kainic acid - and N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) - induced seizures in mice .
B I O O B I I I I I I O B O O O O O O O
Steroids with the 3 - hydroxy group in the alpha - position and 5 - H in the alpha - or beta - configurations were highly effective in protecting against
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pilocarpine ( 416 mg / kg , s . c . ) - induced limbic motor seizures and status epilepticus ( ED50 values , 7 . 0 - 18 .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
7 mg / kg , i . p . ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The corresponding epimers with the 3 - hydroxy group in the beta - position were also effective but less potent ( ED50 values , 33 . 8 - 63 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 , i . p . ) .
O O O O O O O O
Although the neuroactive steroids were considerably less potent than the benzodiazepine clonazepam in protecting against pilocarpine seizures , steroids with the 5 alpha , 3 alpha - configuration had comparable
O O O B O O O O O O B B O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
or higher protective index values ( TD50 for motor impairment divided by ED50 for seizure protection ) than clonazepam , indicating that some neuroactive steroids may have lower relative toxicity
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O
.
O
Steroids with the 5 alpha , 3 alpha - or 5 beta , 3 alpha - configurations also produced a dose - dependent delay in the onset of limbic seizures
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
induced by kainic acid ( 32 mg / kg , s . c . ) , but did not completely protect against the seizures .
O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , when a second dose of the steroid was administered 1 hr after the first dose , complete protection from the kainic acid - induced limbic seizures and status
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
epilepticus was obtained .
O O O O
The steroids also caused a dose - dependent delay in NMDA ( 257 mg / kg , s . c . ) - induced lethality , but did not completely
O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
protect against NMDA seizures or lethality .
O O B O O O O
We conclude that neuroactive steroids are highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine - and kainic acid - induced seizures and status epilepticus in mice , and may be of utility
O O O O B O O O O O O B O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the treatment of some forms of status epilepticus in humans .

SC - 48334 ) ( an alpha - glucosidase I inhibitor ) and zidovudine versus zidovudine alone .
B I I O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O
Patients with 200 to 500 CD4 cells / mm3 who tolerated < or = 12 weeks of prior zidovudine therapy received SC - 48334 ( 1000 mg every 8 h
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I O O O O O O
) and zidovudine ( 100 mg every 8 h ) or zidovudine and placebo .
O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O
Sixty patients received combination therapy and 58 , zidovudine and placebo .
O O O O O O O O B O O O
Twenty - three patients ( 38 % ) and 15 ( 26 % ) , in the combination and zidovudine groups , respectively , discontinued therapy ( p = 0
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O

O O O O
The mean SC - 48334 steady - state trough level ( 4 . 04 + / -
O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
0 . 99 micrograms / ml ) was below the in vitro inhibitory concentration for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mean increase in CD4 cells at week 4 was 73 . 8 cells / mm3 and 52 . 4 cells / mm3 for the combination and zidovudine groups ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
respectively ( p > 0 . 36 ) .
O O O O O O O O O
For patients with prior zidovudine therapy , the mean change in CD4 cells in the combination and zidovudine groups was 63 . 7 cells / mm3 and 4 . 9
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
cells / mm3 at week 8 and 6 . 8 cells / mm3 and - 45 . 1 cells / mm3 at week 16 , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The number of patients with suppression of HIV p24 antigenemia in the combination and zidovudine groups was six ( 40 % ) and two ( 11 % ) at week
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 ( p = 0 . 10 ) and five ( 45 % ) and two ( 14 % ) at week 24 ( p = 0 . 08 )

Recent preclinical and clinical studies with the thymidylate synthase inhibitor N10 - propargyl - 5 , 8 - dideazafolic acid ( CB 3717 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O B I O O
CB 3717 , N10 - propargyl - 5 , 8 - dideazafolic acid , is a tight - binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase ( TS ) whose cytotoxicity is mediated
B I O B I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
solely through the inhibition of this enzyme .
O O O O O O O O
Recent preclinical studies have focused on the intracellular formation of CB 3717 polyglutamates .
O O O O O O O O O O B I O O
Following a 12 - hour exposure of L1210 cells to 50 microM [ 3H ] CB 3717 , 30 % of the extractable radioactivity could be accounted for as
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
CB 3717 tetra - and pentaglutamate , as determined by high - pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) analyses .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As inhibitors of isolated L1210 TS , CB 3717 di - , tri - , tetra - and pentaglutamate are 26 - , 87 - , 119 - and 114
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- fold more potent than CB 3717 , respectively , and their formation may , therefore , be an important determinant of CB 3717 cytotoxicity .
O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O
In early clinical studies with CB 3717 , activity has been seen in breast cancer , ovarian cancer , hepatoma , and mesothelioma .
O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Toxicities included hepatotoxicity , malaise , and dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
This latter effect is thought to be due to drug precipitation within the renal tubule as a result of the poor solubility of CB 3717 under acidic conditions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
In an attempt to overcome this problem , a clinical trial of CB 3717 administered with alkaline diuresis is under way .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
Preliminary results at 400 and 500 mg / m2 suggest that a reduction in nephrotoxicity may have been achieved with only 1 instance of renal toxicity in 10 patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hepatotoxicity and malaise are again the most frequent side effects .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Evidence of antitumor activity has been seen in 3 patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Pharmacokinetic investigations have shown that alkaline diuresis does not alter CB 3717 plasma levels or urinary excretion and that satisfactory urinary alkalinization can be readily achieved .

Ethopropazine and benztropine in neuroleptic - induced parkinsonism .
B O B O O O O O O
In a 12 - week controlled study ethopropazine was compared to benztropine in the treatment of parkinsonism induced by fluphenazine enanthate in 60 schizophrenic outpatients .
O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
Ethopropazine and benztropine were found to be equally effective in controlling parkinsonian symptoms and were as efficacious as procyclidine , their previous antiparkinsonian drug .
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
However , benztropine treated patients had a significant increase in tardive dyskinesia compared to their condition during procyclindine treatment , and significantly more anxiety and depression than ethopropazine treated patients
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O
.
O
This suggests that benztropine is not the anticholinergic drug of choice in the treatment of neuroleptic - induced parkinsonian symptoms , because of its more toxic central and peripheral atropinic
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
effect .

Effect of alpha - tocopherol and deferoxamine on methamphetamine - induced neurotoxicity .
O O B I I O B O B O O O O
Methamphetamine ( MA ) - induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is believed to be associated with the increased formation of free radicals .
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This study examined the effect of alpha - tocopherol ( alpha - TC ) , a scavenger of reactive oxygen species , and deferoxamine ( DFO ) , an
O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O B O O O B O B O O O
iron chelator , on the MA - induced neurotoxicity .
B O O O O B O O O O
Male rats were treated with MA ( 10 mg / kg , every 2 h for four injections ) .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The rat received either alpha - TC ( 20 mg / kg ) intraperitoneally for 3 days and 30 min prior to MA administration or DFO ( 50 mg /
O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O
kg ) subcutaneously 30 min before MA administration .
O O O O O O B O O
The concentrations of dopamine ( DA ) , serotonin and their metabolites decreased significantly after MA administration , which was inhibited by the alpha - TC and DFO pretreatment .
O O O B O B O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I O B O O
alpha - TC and DFO attenuated the MA - induced hyperthermia as well as the alterations in the locomotor activity .
B I I O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The level of lipid peroxidation was higher and the reduced glutathione concentration was lower in the MA - treated rats .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O
These changes were significantly attenuated by alpha - TC and DFO .
O O O O O O B I I O B O
This suggests that alpha - TC and DFO ameliorate the MA - induced neuronal damage by decreasing the level of oxidative stress .

Use of dexamethasone with mesna for the prevention of ifosfamide - induced hemorrhagic cystitis .
O O B O B O O O O B O O O O O
AIM : Hemorrhagic cystitis ( HC ) is a limiting side - effect of chemotherapy with ifosfamide ( IFS ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O
In the study presented here , we investigated the use of dexamethasone in combination with mesna for the prevention of IFS - induced HC .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O B O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Male Wistar rats ( 150 - 200 g ; 6 rats per group ) were treated with saline or mesna 5 min ( i . p . )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
before and 2 and 6 h after ( v . o . ) administration of IFS .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
One , two or three doses of mesna were replaced with dexamethasone alone or with dexamethasone plus mesna .
O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O B O B O
Cystitis was evaluated 24 h after its induction by the changes in bladder wet weight and by macroscopic and microscopic analysis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The replacement of the last dose or the last two doses of mesna with dexamethasone reduced the increase in bladder wet weight induced by IFS by 84 . 79 %
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
and 89 . 13 % , respectively .
O O O O O O O O
In addition , it almost abolished the macroscopic and microscopic alterations induced by IFS .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Moreover , the addition of dexamethasone to the last two doses of mesna was more efficient than three doses of mesna alone when evaluated microscopically .
O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Dexamethasone in combination with mesna was efficient in blocking IFS - induced HC .
B O O O B O O O O B O O O O
However , the replacement of last two doses of mesna with saline or all of the mesna doses with dexamethasone did not prevent HC .

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Reserpine ( 1 mg / kg ) , administered once every other day for 4 days , produced increases in orofacial dyskinesia , tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, which are signs indicative of tardive dyskinesia .
O O O O O O O O O
Reserpine also produced tremor and catalepsy , which are signs suggestive of Parkinson 's disease . MK - 801
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I
( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) , administered 30 min before the observation test , prevented the vacuous chewing movements , tongue protrusions and catalepsy induced by
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
reserpine .
B O
However , MK - 801 injection produced a significant increase of tremor in reserpine - treated mice .
O O B I I O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Reserpine ( 1 mg / kg ) , administered 90 min before the test and followed by apomophine injection ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) 5 min before
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
the test , did not produce oral dyskinesia in mice .
O O O O O O O O O O O
On the other hand , reserpine induced increases in tremor and catalepsy compared to control mice . MK - 801
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I I
( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) administration attenuated the catalepsy and tremor induced by reserpine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Pretreatment with reserpine ( 1 mg / kg ) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion , as well as increases in
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
tremor and catalepsy , whereas MK - 801 ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of reserpine .
O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
These results show that reserpine produces different and abnormal movements , which are related to dose and schedule employed and can be considered as parkinsonian - like and tardive dsykinesia
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
signs .

The glutamatergic blockage produced by NMDA can restore these signs , such as vacuous chewing movements , tongue protrusions , catalepsy and tremor according to the employed model .

Effect of glyceryl trinitrate on the sphincter of Oddi spasm evoked by prostigmine - morphine administration .
O O B I O O O O O O O O B O B O O
OBJECTIVE : In this study the effect of glyceryl trinitrate on the prostigmine - morphine - induced sphincter of Oddi spasm was evaluated in nine female patients with sphincter of
O O O O O O O O B I O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Oddi dyskinesia .
O O O
METHOD :

Sphincter of Oddi spasm was induced by prostigmine - morphine administration ( 0 . 5 mg prostigmine intramuscularly and 10 mg morphine subcutaneously ) and visualized by quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy
O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O
.

The entire procedure was repeated during glyceryl trinitrate infusion ( Nitrolingual 1 microg / kg / min for 120 min ) .
O O O O O O B I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :

CONCLUSION :
O O
These results provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of glyceryl trinitrate on the morphine - induced sphincter of Oddi spasm in humans .
O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B O O O O O O O O O
Since glyceryl trinitrate is able to overcome even the drastic effect of morphine , it might be of relevance in the treatment of sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia .

Effects of acute steroid administration on ventilatory and peripheral muscles in rats .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Occasional case reports have shown that acute myopathy may occur in patients treated with massive doses of corticosteroids .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The mechanism of this myopathy is poorly understood .
O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , 60 male rats were randomly assigned to receive daily injection of saline ( C ) , methylprednisolone ( M ) , or triamcinolone ( T ) 80 mg
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O B O B O O O
/ kg / d for 5 d . Nutritional intake , measured daily in 15 animals , showed a significant reduction of food intake in the steroid - treated groups
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
( - 50 and - 79 % in M and T , respectively ) .
O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O
This was associated with a similar loss in body weight .
O O O O O O O O O O O
In the 45 remaining animals , diaphragm contractility and histopathologic features of several muscles were studied .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Weights of respiratory and peripheral muscles were similarly decreased after steroid treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Maximal twitches of the diaphragm were lower in the C group ( 653 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
174 g / cm ( 2 ) ) than in the M group ( 837 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
171 g / cm ( 2 ) ; p < 0 . 05 ) and the T group ( 765 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
145 g / cm ( 2 ) , NS ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Half - relaxation time was prolonged in both steroid groups , and time to peak tension was longer with M , whereas tetanic tensions were similar .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Steroid treatment also induced a leftward shift of the force - frequency curve at 25 and 50 Hz when compared with saline treatment ( p < 0 . 05 )
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.

ATPase staining of the diaphragm , scalenus medius , and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber atrophy in the steroid groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
atrophy with T , whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of necrosis .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Finally , a pair - fed ( PF ) study , performed in 18 rats ( C , T , and PF ) , showed that muscle atrophy was considerably
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
less pronounced in PF animals than in T - treated animals .
O O O O O O O B O O O O
We conclude that ( 1 ) short - term treatment with massive doses of steroids induced severe respiratory and limb muscle wasting ; ( 2 ) both types of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
steroids induced predominantly type IIb atrophy , resulting in the expected alterations in diaphragm contractile properties ; ( 3 ) neither steroid caused muscle necrosis ; ( 4 ) type
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
IIb atrophy was not caused by acute nutritional deprivation alone .

Refractory cardiogenic shock and complete heart block after verapamil SR and metoprolol treatment .
O O O O O O O O B O O B O O
A case report .
O O O O
A seventy - eight - year - old woman presented with complete heart block and refractory hypotension two days after a therapeutic dose of sustained - release verapamil with concomitant
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
use of metoprolol .
O O B O
The patient continued to remain hypotensive with complete heart block , even with multiple uses of intravenous atropine as well as high doses of pressor agents such as dopamine and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O
dobutamine .

However , shortly after the use of intravenous calcium chloride , the refractory hypotension and complete heart block resolved .

A phase I clinical study of the antipurine antifolate lometrexol ( DDATHF ) given with oral folic acid .
O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O O B I O
Lometrexol is an antifolate which inhibits glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase ( GARFT ) , an enzyme essential for de novo purine synthesis .
B O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that lometrexol has activity against tumours which are refractory to other drugs , notably methotrexate .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
However , the initial clinical development of lometrexol was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative toxicities .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the toxicity of lometrexol can be prevented by low dose folic acid administration , i . e . for 7 days prior to and 7
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
days following a single bolus dose .
O O O O O O O
This observation prompted a Phase I clinical study of lometrexol given with folic acid supplementation which has confirmed that the toxicity of lometrexol can be markedly reduced by
O O O O O O O O O B O O B I O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
folic acid supplementation .
B I O O
Thrombocytopenia and mucositis were the major toxicities .
O O O O O O O O
There was no clear relationship between clinical toxicity and the extent of plasma folate elevation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Associated studies demonstrated that lometrexol plasma pharmacokinetics were not altered by folic acid administration indicating that supplementation is unlikely to reduce toxicity by enhancing lometrexol plasma clearance .
O O O O B O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
The work described in this report has identified for the first time a clinically acceptable schedule for the administration of a GARFT inhibitor .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This information will facilitate the future evaluation of this class of compounds in cancer therapy .

The intradermal injection of mu ( morphine , Tyr - D - Ala - Gly - NMe - Phe - Gly - ol and morphiceptin ) , kappa (

trans - 3 , 4 - dichloro - N - methyl - N [ 2 - ( 1 - pyrrolidinyl ) cyclohexyl ] benzeneactemide ) and delta (

[ D - Pen2 . 5 ] - enkephalin and [ D - Ser2 ] - [ Leu ] enkephalin - Thr ) selective opioid - agonists , by themselves
B I I I I I I I I O B I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O
, did not significantly affect the mechanical nociceptive threshold in the hindpaw of the rat .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Intradermal injection of mu , but not delta or kappa opioid - agonists , however , produced dose - dependent inhibition of prostaglandin E2 - induced hyperalgesia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
The analgesic effect of the mu - agonist morphine was dose - dependently antagonized by naloxone and prevented by co - injection of pertussis toxin .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Morphine did not , however , alter the hyperalgesia induced by 8 - bromo cyclic adenosine monophosphate .
B O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O
We conclude that the analgesic action of opioids on the peripheral terminals of primary afferents is via a binding site with characteristics of the mu - opioid receptor and that
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this action is mediated by inhibition of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate second messenger system .

Adequate timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C . BACKGROUND : Hemolytic anemia is one of the major
O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
adverse events of the combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin .
O O O O O O O B O B O
Because of ribavirin - related hemolytic anemia , dose reduction is a common event in this therapy .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this clinical retrospective cohort study we have examined the suitable timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Thirty - seven of 160 patients who had HCV - genotype 1b , had high virus load , and received 24 - week combination therapy developed anemia with hemoglobin level
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
< 10 g / dl or anemia - related signs during therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After that , these 37 patients were reduced one tablet of ribavirin ( 200 mg ) per day .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
After reduction of ribavirin , 27 of 37 patients could continue combination therapy for a total of 24 weeks ( group A ) .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , 10 of 37 patients with reduction of ribavirin could not continue combination therapy because their < 8 . 5 g / dl hemoglobin values decreased to or anemia
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- related severe side effects occurred ( group B ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O
We assessed the final efficacy and safety after reduction of ribavirin in groups A and B . RESULTS :
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
A sustained virological response ( SVR ) was 29 . 6 % ( 8 / 27 ) in group A and 10 % ( 1 / 10 ) in group
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
B , respectively .
O O O O
A 34 . 4 % ( 12 / 27 ) of SVR + biological response in group A was higher than 10 % ( 1 / 10 ) in group
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
B ( P = 0 . 051 ) , with slight significance .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
With respect to hemoglobin level at the time of ribavirin reduction , a rate of continuation of therapy in patients with > or = 10 g / dl hemoglobin was
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
higher than that in patients with < 10 g / dl ( P = 0 . 036 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS : Reduction of ribavirin at hemoglobin level > or = 10 g / dl
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
is suitable in terms of efficacy and side effects .

Increased expression and apical targeting of renal ENaC subunits in puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrotic syndrome in rats .
O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
Nephrotic syndrome is often accompanied by sodium retention and generalized edema .
O O O O O O B O O O O O
However , the molecular basis for the decreased renal sodium excretion remains undefined .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
We hypothesized that epithelial Na channel ( ENaC ) subunit dysregulation may be responsible for the increased sodium retention .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
An experimental group of rats was treated with puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ; 180 mg / kg iv ) , whereas the control group received only vehicle .
O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After 7 days , PAN treatment induced significant proteinuria , hypoalbuminemia , decreased urinary sodium excretion , and extensive ascites .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The protein abundance of alpha - ENaC and beta - ENaC was increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla ( ISOM ) and in the inner medulla (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
IM ) but was not altered in the cortex .
O O O O O O O O O O
gamma - ENaC abundance was increased in the cortex , ISOM , and IM .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Immunoperoxidase brightfield - and laser - scanning confocal fluorescence
O O O O O O O O O
microscopy demonstrated increased targeting of alpha - ENaC , beta - ENaC , and gamma - ENaC subunits to the apical plasma membrane in the distal convoluted tubule ( DCT2
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) , connecting tubule , and cortical and medullary collecting duct segments .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Immunoelectron microscopy further revealed an increased labeling of alpha - ENaC in the apical plasma membrane of cortical collecting duct principal cells of PAN - treated rats , indicating enhanced
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
apical targeting of alpha - ENaC subunits .
O O O O O O O O
In contrast , the protein abundances of Na ( + ) / H ( + ) exchanger type 3 ( NHE3 ) , Na ( + ) - K (
O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O
+ ) - 2Cl ( - ) cotransporter ( BSC - 1 ) , and thiazide - sensitive Na ( + ) - Cl ( - ) cotransporter ( TSC
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O B O O O O O O
) were decreased .
O O O O
Moreover , the abundance of the alpha ( 1 ) - subunit of the Na - K - ATPase was decreased in the cortex and ISOM , but it remained
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unchanged in the IM .
O O O O O
In conclusion , the increased or sustained expression of ENaC subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the DCT2 , connecting tubule , and collecting duct are likely to play
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a role in the sodium retention associated with PAN - induced nephrotic syndrome .
O O O O B O O O B O O O O O
The decreased abundance of NHE3 , BSC - 1 , TSC , and Na - K - ATPase may play a compensatory role to promote sodium excretion .

Does hormone therapy for the treatment of breast cancer have a detrimental effect on memory and cognition ?
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A pilot study .
O O O O
This pilot study examines whether hormone therapy for breast cancer affects cognition .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients participating in a randomised trial of anastrozole , tamoxifen alone or combined ( ATAC ) ( n = 94 ) and a group of women without breast cancer (
O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
n = 35 ) completed a battery of neuropsychological measures .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Compared with the control group , the patients were impaired on a processing speed task ( p = 0 . 032 ) and on a measure of immediate verbal memory
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( p = 0 . 026 ) after controlling for the use of hormone replacement therapy in both groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patient group performance was not significantly related to length of treatment or measures of psychological morbidity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results showed specific impairments in processing speed and verbal memory in women receiving hormonal therapy for the treatment of breast cancer .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Verbal memory may be especially sensitive to changes in oestrogen levels , a finding commonly reported in studies of hormone replacement therapy in healthy women .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In view of the increased use of hormone therapies in an adjuvant and preventative setting their impact on cognitive functioning should be investigated more thoroughly .

Association of nitric oxide production and apoptosis in a model of experimental nephropathy .
O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND : In recent studies increased amounts of nitric oxide ( NO ) and apoptosis have been implicated in various pathological conditions in the kidney .
O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have studied the role of NO and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of nephrotic syndrome induced by a single injection of adriamycin ( ADR ) .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O
METHODS :
O O
The alteration in the NO pathway was assessed by measuring nitrite levels in serum / urine and by evaluating the changes in vascular reactivity of the isolated perfused rat kidney
O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( IPRK ) system .
O O O O O
Rats were stratified into control groups and ADR - induced nephropathy groups .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O
These two groups were then divided into : group 1 , animals receiving saline ; and group 2 , animals receiving aminoguanidine ( AG ) which is a specific inhibitor
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O
of inducible - NO synthase .
O O O B O O
On day 21 , rats were sacrificed after obtaining material for biochemical analysis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Histopathological examination of the kidneys of rats treated with ADR revealed focal areas of mesangial proliferation and mild tubulointerstitial inflammation .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
They also had significantly higher levels of proteinuria compared with control and treatment groups ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Urine nitrite levels were significantly increased in the ADR - nephropathy group ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
In the IPRK phenylephrine and acetylcholine related responses were significantly impaired in the ADR - nephropathy group .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O B O O O O
Apoptosis was not detected in controls .
O O O O O O O
However , in the ADR - nephropathy group , numerous apoptotic cells were identified in the tubulointerstitial areas .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Double staining revealed numerous interstitial apoptotic cells to stain for ED1 , a marker for monocytes / macrophages .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Treatment with AG prevented the impairment of renal vascular bed responses and reduced both urine nitrite levels and apoptosis to control levels .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
We suggest that interactions between NO and apoptosis are important in the pathogenesis of the ADR - induced nephrosis .

The attenuating effect of carteolol hydrochloride , a beta - adrenoceptor antagonist , on neuroleptic - induced catalepsy in rats .
O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is known that beta - adrenoceptor antagonists are effective in the treatment of akathisia , one of the extrapyramidal side effects that occur during neuroleptic treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Neuroleptic - induced catalepsy , a model of neuroleptic - induced extrapyramidal side effects , was considered suitable as a model for predicting neuroleptic - induced akathisia in humans ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although neuroleptic - induced catalepsy was not considered a specific test for neuroleptic - induced akathisia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , the effects of carteolol , a beta - adrenoceptor antagonist , on haloperidol - induced catalepsy in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of propranolol and
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
biperiden , a muscarinic receptor antagonist .
B O O O O O O
Carteolol , as well as propranolol and biperiden , inhibited the haloperidol - induced catalepsy .

The inhibitory effect of carteolol was almost comparable to that of propranolol , but was weaker than that of biperiden .
O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O
Carteolol did not evoke postsynaptic dopamine receptor - stimulating behavioral signs such as stereotypy and hyperlocomotion in rats .
B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Carteolol did not antagonize the inhibitory effects of haloperidol on apomorphine - induced stereotypy and locomotor activity in rats .
B O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O
In addition , carteolol did not evoke 5 - HT1A receptor - stimulating behavioral signs such as flat body posture and forepaw treading and did not inhibit

Finally , carteolol did not inhibit physostigmine - induced lethality in rats .

These results strongly suggest that carteolol improves haloperidol - induced catalepsy via its beta - adrenoceptor antagonistic activity and is expected to be effective in the treatment of akathisia without

Thromboembolic and other complications of oral contraceptive therapy in relationship to pretreatment levels of blood coagulation factors : summary report of a ten - year study .
O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
During a ten - year period , 348 women were studied for a total of 5 , 877 patient months in four separate studies relating oral contraceptives to changes in
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O
hematologic parameters .
O O O
Significant increases in certain factors of the blood coagulation and fibrinolysin systems ( factors I , II , VII , VIII , IX , and X and plasminogen ) were
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
observed in the treated groups .
O O O O O O
Severe complications developed in four patients .
O O O O O O O
All four had an abnormal blood coagulation profile , suggesting """" hypercoagulability """" before initiation of therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some of these findings represented the most extreme abnormalities seen in the entire group of patients ; some increased further during therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One of these patients developed a myocardial infarction before receiving any medication , shortly after the base - line values were obtained .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One patient developed retinopathy 19 months after she began therapy , and another developed thrombophlebitis after 27 months of therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The fourth patient developed thrombophlebitis 14 days after initiation of contraceptive therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All four patients were of the A or AB blood group .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Previous studies suggested the possiblility of increased propensity for thromboembolic episodes in patients possessing the A antigen .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It appears from these data that hematologic work - ups may be useful in women who are about to start long - term oral contraceptive therapy .

Effects of UMB24 and ( + / - ) - SM 21 , putative sigma2 - preferring antagonists , on behavioral toxic and stimulant effects of cocaine in mice .
O O B O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Earlier studies have demonstrated that antagonism of sigma1 receptors attenuates the convulsive , lethal , locomotor stimulatory and rewarding actions of cocaine in mice .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
In contrast , the contribution of sigma2 receptors is unclear because experimental tools to selectively target this subtype are unavailable .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To begin addressing this need , we characterized UMB24 ( 1 - ( 2 - phenethyl ) - 4 - ( 2 - pyridyl ) - piperazine ) and (
O O O O O O O O B O B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O
+ / - ) - SM 21 ( 3alpha - tropanyl - 2 - ( 4 - chorophenoxy ) butyrate ) in receptor binding and behavioral studies .
O O O O O B I O B I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O
Receptor binding studies confirmed that UMB24 and ( + / - ) - SM 21 display preferential affinity for sigma2 over sigma1 receptors .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O
In behavioral studies , pretreatment of Swiss Webster mice with UMB24 or ( + / - ) - SM 21 significantly attenuated cocaine - induced convulsions and locomotor activity ,
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I O O B O O O O O O O
but not lethality .
O O O O
When administered alone , ( + / - ) - SM 21 produced no significant effects compared to control injections of saline , but UMB24 had locomotor depressant actions .
O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Together , the data suggest that sigma2 receptor antagonists have the potential to attenuate some of the behavioral effects of cocaine , and further development of more selective , high
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
affinity ligands are warranted .

Methimazole - induced cholestatic jaundice .
B O O O O O
Methimazole is a widely used and generally well - tolerated antithyroid agent .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 43 - year - old woman had severe jaundice and itching 1 month after receiving methimazole ( 10 mg tid ) and propranolol ( 20 mg tid ) for
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O
treatment of hyperthyroidism .
O O O O
The patient continued treatment for another 4 days after the appearance of jaundice until she finished both medications .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When seen at the emergency department 2 weeks later , she still had severe icterus , pruritus , and hyperbilirubinemia , formed mainly of the conjugated fraction .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Methimazole - induced cholestasis was diagnosed , and propranolol therapy was resumed .
B O O O O O O O B O O O O
Over the following 9 days , the symptoms improved and plasma bilirubin levels were normal after 12 weeks without methimazole .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O
In rare cases within the first few weeks of therapy , this drug can cause severe and reversible cholestatic jaundice .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Physicians and patients should be aware of this adverse effect so that , upon occurrence , they can discontinue methimazole therapy and avoid unnecessary invasive procedures .

The combination of both side effects is extremely rare .
O O O O O O O O O O
In this report , we describe a case of ciprofloxacin - induced interstitial nephritis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Hemolytic anemia improved after stopping the drug and initiation of steroid therapy .

Contribution of sodium valproate to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone .
O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
We report the case of a 62 - year - old man who was administered sodium valproate ( VPA ) and who subsequently developed the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O
antidiuretic hormone ( SIADH ) .
O O O O O O
He had been taking VPA for treatment of idiopathic generalized tonic - clonic convulsions since he was 56 years old .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After substituting VPA with zonisamide , the serum sodium level returned to normal .
O O B O B O O O B O O O O O
We consider this episode of SIADH to be the result of a combination of factors including a weakness of the central nervous system and the long - term administration of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
VPA .

Vasopressin in the treatment of milrinone - induced hypotension in severe heart failure .
B O O O O B O O O O O O O O
The use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as milrinone in the treatment of severe heart failure is frequently restricted because they cause vasodilation and hypotension .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In patients with decompensated heart failure with hypotension after treatment with milrinone , low doses of vasopressin restored blood pressure without inhibiting the inotropic effect of milrinone .

Halogenated anesthetics form liver adducts and antigens that cross - react with halothane - induced antibodies .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Two halogenated anesthetics , enflurane and isoflurane , have been associated with an allergic - type hepatic injury both alone and following previous exposure to halothane .
O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Halothane hepatitis appears to involve an aberrant immune response .
B O O O O O O O O O
An antibody response to a protein - bound biotransformation product ( trifluoroacetyl adduct ) has been detected on halothane hepatitis patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O
This study was performed to determine cross - reactivity between enflurane and isoflurane with the hypersensitivity induced by halothane .
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O B O
The subcellular and lobular production of hepatic neoantigens recognized by halothane - induced antibodies following enflurane and isoflurane , and the biochemical nature of these neoantigens was investigated in two
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
animal models .
O O O
Enflurane administration resulted in neoantigens detected in both the microsomal and cytosolic fraction of liver homogenates and in the centrilobular region of the liver .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the same liver , biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adducts that were up to 20 - fold greater in guinea pigs than in rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This supports and extends previous evidence for a mechanism by which enflurane and / or isoflurane could produce a hypersensitivity condition similar to that of halothane hepatitis either alone or
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
subsequent to halothane administration .
O O B O O
The guinea pig would appear to be a useful model for further investigations of the immunological response to these antigens .

Effects on hepatocyte fine structure .
O O O O O O
Groups of male and female inbred Leeds strain rats were fed diets containing either 0 . 5 % or 1 . 0 % paracetamol by weight for up to 18
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
months .
O O
At the 1 . 0 % dosage level , 20 % of rats of both sexes developed neoplastic nodules of the liver , a statistically significant incidence .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These rats also showed gross enlargement of their livers and an increase in foci of cellular alteration , the latter also being observed in the low dosage male rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Papillomas of the transitional epithelium of the bladder developed in all paracetamol - treated groups , and three rats bore bladder carcinomas .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
However , significant yields of bladder tumours were only obtained from low dosage females and high dosage males .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Additionally , 20 to 25 % of paracetamol - treated rats developed hyperplasia of the bladder epithelium , which was not coincident with the presence of bladder calculi .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A low yield of tumours at various other sites also arose following paracetamol feeding .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
An electron microscope study of the livers of paracetamol - treated rats revealed ultrastructural changes in the hepatocytes that resemble those that result from exposure to a variety of known

Repair of local anesthetic - induced damage .
O O O O O O O O
Local anesthetics that are commonly used in ophthalmic surgery ( 0 . 75 % bupivacaine hydrochloride , 2 . 0 % mepivacaine hydrochloride , and 2 . 0 %
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B I O O O O O O
lidocaine hydrochloride plus 1 : 100 , 000 epinephrine ) were injected into the retrobulbar area of rat eyes .
B I O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Controls were injected with physiological saline .
O O O O O O O
All three anesthetics produced massive degeneration of the extraocular muscles .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Muscle degeneration is followed by regeneration of the damaged muscle fibers .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition to muscle damage , severe damage was also seen in harderian glands , especially after exposure to mepivacaine and lidocaine plus epinephrine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O
With these findings in rats , it is hypothesized that the temporary diplopia sometimes seen in patients after ophthalmic surgery might be due to anesthetic - induced damage to the

extraocular muscles .

The novel anxiolytic drug , buspirone , reverses catalepsy induced by haloperidol .
O O O O O B O O O O O B O
A series of aryl - piperazine analogues of buspirone and other 5 - hydroxytryptaminergic agonists were tested for their ability to reverse haloperidol induced catalepsy .
O O O B I I O O B O O B I I I O O O O O O O B O O O
Those drugs with strong affinity for 5 - hydroxytryptamine1a receptors were able to reverse catalepsy .
O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
Drugs with affinity for other 5 - HT receptors or weak affinity were ineffective .
O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
However , inhibition of postsynaptic 5 - HT receptors neither inhibited nor potentiated reversal of catalepsy and leaves open the question as to the site or mechanism for this effect

Diazepam facilitates reflex bradycardia in conscious rats .
B O O O O O O O
The effects of diazepam on cardiovascular function were assessed in conscious rats .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Intravenous administration of diazepam ( 1 - 30 mg kg - 1 ) produced a dose - dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also , reflex bradycardia was produced in rats by intravenous infusion of adrenaline ( 1 . 25 - 2 . 5 micrograms kg - 1 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Intravenous pretreatment of the rats with diazepam , although causing no change in the adrenaline - induced pressor effect , did enhance the adrenaline - induced reflex bradycardia .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
However , the diazepam enhancement of adrenaline - induced reflex bradycardia was antagonized by pretreatment of rats with an intravenous dose of picrotoxin ( an agent blocks chloride channels by
O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O
binding to sites associated with the benzodiazepine - GABA - chloride channel macromolecular complex ) .
O O O O O O B O B O B O O O O O
The data indicate that diazepam acts through the benzodiazepine - GABA - chloride channel macromolecular complex within the central nervous system to facilitate reflex bradycardia mediated through baroreceptor reflexes in
O O O O B O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
response to an acute increase in arterial pressure .

Chronic carbamazepine inhibits the development of local anesthetic seizures kindled by cocaine and lidocaine .
O B O O O O O O O O O B O B O
The effects of carbamazepine ( CBZ ) treatment on local anesthetic - kindled seizures and lethality were evaluated in different stages of the kindling process and under different methods of
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CBZ administration .
B O O
Chronic oral CBZ inhibited the development of both lidocaine - and cocaine - induced seizures , but had little effect on the fully developed local anesthetic seizures .
O O B O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Chronic CBZ also decreased the incidence of seizure - related mortality in the cocaine - injected rats .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Acute CBZ over a range of doses ( 15 - 50 mg / kg ) had no effect on completed lidocaine - kindled or acute cocaine - induced seizures .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O
Repeated i . p .
O O O O O
injection of CBZ ( 15 mg / kg ) also was without effect on the development of lidocaine - or cocaine - kindled seizures .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O
The differential effects of CBZ depending upon stage of seizure development suggest that distinct mechanisms underlie the development versus maintenance of local anesthetic - kindled seizures .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The effectiveness of chronic but not repeated , intermittent injections of CBZ suggests that different biochemical consequences result from the different treatment regimens .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
The possible utility of chronic CBZ in preventing the development of toxic side effects in human cocaine users is suggested by these data , but remains to be directly evaluated

Case reports of 11 patients with severe , extensive localized scleroderma who were treated with D - penicillamine are summarized in this article .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O
This drug was judged to have a favorable effect on the disease course in 7 ( 64 % ) of 11 patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Improvement began within 3 to 6 months and consisted of cessation of active cutaneous lesions in all 7 patients , skin softening in 5 , and more normal growth of

Effect of Hibiscus rosa sinensis on reserpine - induced neurobehavioral and biochemical alterations in rats .
O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O
Effect of methanolic extract of Hibiscus rosa sinensis ( 100 - 300 mg / kg ) was studied on reserpine - induced orofacial dyskinesia and neurochemical alterations .
O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
The rats were treated with intraperitoneal reserpine ( 1 mg / kg , ip ) for 3 days every other day .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On day 5 , vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions were counted for 5 min .

Comparison of aqueous and gellan ophthalmic timolol with placebo on the 24 - hour heart rate response in patients on treatment for glaucoma .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PURPOSE :
O O
Topical beta - blocker treatment is routine therapy in the management of patients with glaucoma .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therapy results in systemic absorption , however , the degree of reduction of resting and peak heart rate has not been quantified .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DESIGN :
O O
This trial evaluated the effect of placebo , 0 . 5 % aqueous timolol ( timolol solution ) and a 0 . 5 % timolol suspension that forms a gel
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
on application to the conjunctiva ( timolol gellan ) on the 24 - hour heart rate in patients currently being treated for glaucoma to quantify the reduction in mean heart
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rate .
O O
METHODS :
O O
Forty - three Caucasian patients with primary open - angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension with a mean ( + / - SD ) age of 63 ( + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8 ) years were randomized and crossed over in a double - masked manner to 14 days of treatment with placebo ( morning and evening in both eyes ) ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
timolol solution ( morning and evening in both eyes ) , or timolol gellan ( morning in both eyes with placebo in the evening ) .
B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On the 13th day of each period , heart rate was recorded continuously during a typical , ambulant 24 - hour period .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Both timolol solution and timolol gellan reduced the mean 24 - hour heart rate compared with placebo ( P < or = . 001 ) , and this reduction was
O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
most pronounced during the daytime ( - 7 . 5 % change in mean heart rate , - 5 . 7 beats / min ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Timolol gellan showed a numerically but not significantly smaller reduction in 24 - hour heart rate , compared with timolol solution .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
During the night , the mean 12 - hour heart rate on placebo and timolol gellan were both significantly less than on timolol solution ; the difference between solution and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
gellan treatments was statistically significant ( P = . 01 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Both timolol solution and timolol gellan decrease the mean 24 - hour heart rate compared with placebo .
O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This response was most pronounced during the active daytime period .
O O O O O O O O O O O
These data quantify the modest bradycardia associated with ophthalmic beta - blocker therapy in a typical patient population on therapy for glaucoma .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although exercise performance was not assessed in this trial , reductions of this magnitude should not have substantial clinical consequences .

5 flourouracil - induced apical ballooning syndrome : a case report .
B I O O O O O O O O O O
The apical ballooning syndrome ( ABS ) is a recently described stress - mediated acute cardiac syndrome characterized by transient wall - motion abnormalities involving the apex and midventricle with
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hyperkinesis of the basal left ventricular ( LV ) segments without obstructive epicardial coronary disease .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cardiotoxicity is not an uncommon adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents .
O O O O O O O O O O O
However , there are no reports of ABS secondary to chemotherapeutic agents .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We describe the case of a woman who developed the syndrome after chemotherapy for metastatic cancer .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 79 - year - old woman presented with typical ischemic chest pain , elevated cardiac enzymes with significant ST - segment abnormalities on her electrocardiogram .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She underwent recent chemotherapy with fluorouracil for metastatic colorectal cancer .
O O O O O B O O O O O
Echocardiography revealed a wall - motion abnormality involving the apical and periapical segments which appeared akinetic .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Coronary angiography revealed no obstructive coronary lesions .
O O O O O O O O
The patient was stabilized with medical therapy .
O O O O O O O O
Four weeks later she remained completely asymptomatic .
O O O O O O O O
Echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction and a resolution of the apical akinesis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pathogenetic mechanisms of cardiac complications in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy include coronary vasospasm , endothelial damage and consequent thrombus formation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In our patient , both supraphysiologic levels of plasma catecholamines and stress related neuropeptides caused by cancer diagnosis as well as chemotherapy may have contributed the development of ABS .

Reduction of pain during induction with target - controlled propofol and remifentanil .
O O O O O O O O O B O B O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Pain on injection of propofol is unpleasant .
O O O O B O O O
We hypothesized that propofol infusion pain might be prevented by infusing remifentanil before starting the propofol infusion in a clinical setting where target - controlled infusions ( TCI ) of
O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
both drugs were used .
O O O O O
A prospective , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial was performed to determine the effect - site concentration ( Ce ) of remifentanil to prevent the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
pain without producing complications .
O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
A total of 128 patients undergoing general surgery were randomly allocated to receive normal saline ( control ) or remifentanil to a target
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Ce of 2 ng ml ( - 1 ) ( R2 )
O O O O O O O O O O O O

O O O O O O O O
( R4 ) , or 6 ng ml ( - 1 ) ( R6 ) administered via TCI .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After the target Ce was achieved , the infusion of propofol was started .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Remifentanil - related complications were assessed during the remifentanil infusion , and pain caused by propofol was evaluated using a four - point scale during the propofol infusion .
B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O
RESULTS :
O O
The incidence of pain was significantly lower in Groups R4 and R6 than in the control and R2 groups ( 12 / 32 and 6 / 31 vs 26 /
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
31 and 25 / 32 , respectively , P < 0 . 001 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pain was less severe in Groups R4 and R6 than in the control and R2 groups ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , both incidence and severity of pain were not different between Groups R4 and R6 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No significant complications were observed during the study .
O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
During induction of anaesthesia with TCI of propofol and remifentanil , a significant reduction in propofol infusion pain was achieved without significant complications by prior administration of remifentanil at a

Prenatal exposure to fluoxetine induces fetal pulmonary hypertension in the rat .
O O O B O O O O O O O O
RATIONALE : Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant widely used by pregnant women .
O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Epidemiological data suggest that fluoxetine exposure prenatally increases the prevalence of persistent pulmonary hypertension syndrome of the newborn .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear and paradoxical , considering the current evidence of a pulmonary hypertension protective fluoxetine effect in adult rodents .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
OBJECTIVES :
O O
To evaluate the fluoxetine effect on fetal rat pulmonary vascular smooth muscle mechanical properties and cell proliferation rate .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Pregnant rats were treated with fluoxetine ( 10 mg / kg ) from Day 11 through Day 21 of gestation .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS :
O O O O O
Fetuses were delivered by cesarean section .
O O O O O O O
As compared with controls , fluoxetine exposure resulted in fetal pulmonary hypertension as evidenced by an increase in the weight ratio of the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
septum ( P = 0 . 02 ) and by an increase in pulmonary arterial medial thickness ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Postnatal mortality was increased among experimental animals , and arterial oxygen saturation was 96 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
1 % in 1 - day - old control animals and significantly lower ( P < 0 . 01 ) in fluoxetine - exposed pups ( 79 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
2 % ) .
O O O O
In vitro , fluoxetine induced pulmonary arterial muscle contraction in fetal , but not adult , animals ( P < 0 . 01 ) and reduced serotonin - induced contraction
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
at both ages ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O
After in utero exposure to a low fluoxetine concentration the pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation rate was significantly increased in fetal , but not adult , cells ( P
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
< 0 . 01 ) .
O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
In contrast to the adult , fluoxetine exposure in utero induces pulmonary hypertension in the fetal rat as a result of a developmentally regulated increase in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle

Syncope and QT prolongation among patients treated with methadone for heroin dependence in the city of Copenhagen .
O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Methadone is prescribed to heroin addicts to decrease illicit opioid use .
B O O O B O O O O O O O
Prolongation of the QT interval in the ECG of patients with torsade de pointes ( TdP ) has been reported in methadone users .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
As heroin addicts sometimes faint while using illicit drugs , doctors might attribute too many episodes of syncope to illicit drug use and thereby underestimate the incidence of TdP in
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this special population , and the high mortality in this population may , in part , be caused by the proarrhythmic effect of methadone .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
METHODS :
O O
In this cross - sectional study interview , ECGs and blood samples were collected in a population of adult heroin addicts treated with methadone or buprenorphine on a daily basis
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O B O O O O
.
O
Of the patients at the Drug Addiction Service in the municipal of Copenhagen , 450 ( approximately 52 % ) were included .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The QT interval was estimated from 12 lead ECGs .
O O O O O O O O O O
All participants were interviewed about any experience of syncope .
O O O O O O O O O O
The association between opioid dose and QT , and methadone dose and reporting of syncope was assessed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Methadone dose was associated with longer QT interval of 0 . 140 ms / mg ( p = 0 . 002 ) .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No association between buprenorphine and QTc was found .
O O O B O O O O O
Among the subjects treated with methadone , 28 % men and 32 % women had prolonged QTc interval .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
None of the subjects treated with buprenorphine had QTc interval > 0 . 440 s ( ( 1 / 2 ) ) .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 50 mg higher methadone dose was associated with a 1 . 2 ( 95 % CI 1 . 1 to 1 . 4 ) times higher odds for syncope
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.

CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Methadone is associated with QT prolongation and higher reporting of syncope in a population of heroin addicts .

Peripheral neuropathy caused by high - dose cytosine arabinoside treatment in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia .
O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O
The central nervous system toxicity of high - dose cytosine arabinoside is well recognized , but the toxicity of cytosine arabinoside in the peripheral nervous system has been infrequently reported
O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O
.
O
A 49 - year - old Japanese man was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After he achieved complete remission , he received high - dose cytosine arabinoside treatment ( 2 g
O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
/ m2 twice a day for 5 days
O O O O O O O O
; total , 20 g / m2 ) as consolidation therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The first course of high - dose cytosine arabinoside resulted in no unusual symptoms , but on day 21 of the second course of treatment , the patient complained of
O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
numbness in his right foot .
O O O O O O
Electromyogram and nerve - conduction studies showed peripheral neuropathy in both peroneal nerves .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This neuropathy was gradually resolving ; however , after the patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation , the symptoms worsened , with the development of graft - versus - host
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
disease , and the symptoms subsequently responded to methylprednisolone .
O O O O O O O O B O
Although the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathy are still unclear , high - dose cytosine arabinoside is a therapy that is potentially toxic to the peripheral nervous system , and auto

Sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil for calcineurin - free immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients .
B O B I O O O O O O O O O O
Calcineurin inhibitors , such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus , have been available for almost 20 years .
O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O
Although these drugs are highly effective and represent the mainstay of transplant immunosuppression , they are associated with acute and chronic nephrotoxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Acute nephrotoxicity , which occurs in the early period after transplantation , leads to a higher rate of dialysis , and chronic nephrotoxicity may eventually result in graft loss .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Acute and chronic nephrotoxicity is becoming more common as the use of marginal kidneys for transplantation increases .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two recently available immunosuppressive agents , mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus ( rapamycin ) , have no nephrotoxicity .
O O O O O O B I O B O B O O O O O O
The use of these drugs in combination with other agents has led to the development of new paradigms of immunosuppressive therapy .

Anemia was induced using a single dose of carboplatin ( 50 mg / kg i . v . ) resulting in a long - lasting reduction ( 30 % )
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of the hemoglobin concentration .
O O O O O
In a second group , the development of anemia was prevented by rHuEPO ( 1000 IU / kg ) administered s . c .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
three times / week starting 7 days before carboplatin application .
O O O O O O O O B O O
Four days after carboplatin treatment , tumors ( DS - sarcoma of the rat ) were implanted s . c .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
onto the hind food dorsum .
O O O O O O
Neither carboplatin nor rHuEPO treatment influenced tumor growth rate per se .
O B O O O O O O O O O O
When tumors were treated with a single dose of cyclophosphamide ( 60 mg / kg
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
i . p . )
O O O O O
5 days after implantation , a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the tumors was observed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the anemia group , the growth delay was significantly shorter compared with nonanemic controls ( 13 . 3 days versus 8 . 6 days ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the group where anemia was prevented by rHuEPO treatment , growth delay was comparable with that of nonanemic controls ( 13 . 3 days ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that chemotherapy - induced anemia reduces cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in tumors , whereas correction of anemia by rHuEPO treatment ( epoetin alpha ) increases the sensitivity ,
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
probably as a result of an improved oxygen supply to tumor tissue .

The role of nitrergic system in lidocaine - induced convulsion in the mouse .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The effects of N - nitro - L - arginine - methyl ester ( L - NAME ) a nitric oxide ( NO ) synthase inhibitor and
O O O B I I I I I I I I I O B I I O O B I O B O O O O
L - arginine , a NO precursor , were investigated on lidocaine - induced convulsions .
B I I O O B O O O O O B O O O O
In the first experiment , four groups of mice received physiological saline ( 0 . 9 % ) , L - arginine ( 300 mg / kg , i .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
p . ) , L - NAME ( 100 mg / kg , i . p . ) and diazepam ( 2 mg / kg ) , respectively .
O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Thirty minutes after these injections , all mice received lidocaine ( 50 mg / kg , i . p . ) .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the second experiment , four groups of mice received similar treatment in the first experiment , and 30 min after these injections , all mice received a higher dose
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of lidocaine ( 80 mg / kg ) .
O B O O O O O O O
L - NAME ( 100 mg / kg , i . p . ) and diazepam ( 2 mg / kg ) significantly decreased the incidence of lidocaine ( 50
B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
mg / kg ) - induced convulsions .
O O O O O O O O
In contrast , the L - arginine treatment increased the incidence of lidocaine ( 80 mg / kg , i . p . ) - induced convulsions significantly .
O O O O B I I O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results may suggest that NO is a proconvulsant mediator in lidocaine - induced convulsions .

Effect of intravenous metoprolol or intravenous metoprolol plus glucagon on dobutamine - induced myocardial ischemia .
O O O B O O B O O O B O O O O O
STUDY OBJECTIVE :
O O O
To determine the effect of metoprolol on dobutamine stress testing with technetium - 99 m sestamibi single - photon emission computed tomography imaging and ST - segment monitoring , and
O O O O O B O B O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to assess the impact of intravenous glucagon on metoprolol 's effects .
O O O O O O O O B O O O
DESIGN :
O O
Randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial .
O O O O O O O O O O O
SETTING :
O O
Community hospital .
O O O
PATIENTS :
O O
Twenty - two patients with known reversible perfusion defects .
O O O O O O O O O O
INTERVENTION :
O O
Patients underwent dobutamine stress tests per standard protocol .
O O B O O O O O O
Before dobutamine was begun , no therapy was given during the first visit , and patients were randomized on subsequent visits to receive metoprolol or metoprolol plus glucagon 1 mg
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O
.
O
Metoprolol was dosed to achieve a resting predobutamine heart rate below 65 beats / minute or a total intravenous dose of 20 mg .
B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS :
O O O O O
Metoprolol reduced maximum heart rate 31 % , summed stress scores 29 % , and summed difference scores 43 % versus control .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Metoprolol plus glucagon also reduced the maximum heart rate 29 % versus control .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Summed stress and summed difference scores were not significantly reduced , although they were 18 % and 30 % lower , respectively , than control .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No significant differences were found in any parameter between metoprolol and metoprolol - glucagon .
O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
During dobutamine stress testing , metoprolol attenuates or eliminates evidence of myocardial ischemia .
O B O O O B O O O O O O O O
Glucagon 1 mg , although somewhat effective , does not correct this effect to the extent that it can be administered clinically .

Prednisolone - induced muscle dysfunction is caused more by atrophy than by altered acetylcholine receptor expression .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Large doses of glucocorticoids can alter muscle physiology and susceptibility to neuromuscular blocking drugs by mechanisms not clearly understood .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We investigated the effects of moderate and large doses of prednisolone on muscle function and pharmacology , and their relationship to changes in muscle size and acetylcholine receptor ( AChR
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
) expression .
O O O
With institutional approval , 35 Sprague - Dawley rats were randomly allocated to receive daily subcutaneous doses of 10 mg / kg prednisolone ( P10 group ) , 100 mg
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
/ kg prednisolone ( P100 group ) , or an equal volume of saline ( S group ) for 7 days .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A fourth group of rats was pair fed ( food restricted ) with the P100 rats for 7 days ( FR group ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On Day 8 , the nerve - evoked peak twitch tensions , tetanic tensions , and fatigability , and the dose - response curves of d - tubocurarine in the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
tibialis cranialis muscle were measured in vivo and related to muscle mass or expression of AChRs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Rate of body weight gain was depressed in the P100 , FR , and P10 groups compared with the S group .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Tibialis muscle mass was smaller in the P100 group than in the P10 or S groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The evoked peak twitch and tetanic tensions were less in the P100 group than in the P10 or S groups , however , tension per milligram of muscle mass was
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
greater in the P100 group than in the S group .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The 50 % effective dose of d - tubocurarine ( microg / kg ) in the tibialis muscle was smaller in the P10 ( 33 . 6 + / -
O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 . 4 ) than in the S ( 61 . 9 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 . 0 ) or the P100 ( 71 . 3 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
9 . 6 ) groups .
O O O O O O
AChR expression was less in the P10 group than in the S group .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The evoked tensions correlated with muscle mass ( r ( 2 ) = 0 . 32 , P < 0 . 001 ) , however , not with expression of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
AChR .
O O
The 50 % effective dose of d - tubocurarine did not correlate with muscle mass or AChR expression .
O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
Our results suggest that the neuromuscular dysfunction after prednisolone is dose - dependent , and derives primarily from muscle atrophy and derives less so from changes in AChR expression .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
IMPLICATIONS :
O O
The mechanisms by which chronic glucocorticoid therapy alters neuromuscular physiology and pharmacology are unclear .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We suggest that the observed effects are dose - dependent and derive primarily from muscle atrophy and derive less from changes in acetylcholine receptor expression .

Rapid reversal of life - threatening diltiazem - induced tetany with calcium chloride .
O O O O O O B O O O O B I O
We describe a patient who developed tetany with sudden respiratory arrest after the infusion of intravenous diltiazem .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The administration of calcium chloride rapidly resolved the patient 's tetany with prompt recovery of respiratory function , averting the need for more aggressive airway management and ventilatory support .
O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The emergency physician should be aware that life - threatening tetany may accompany the administration of intravenous diltiazem and that calcium chloride may be a rapid and effective remedy .

Effects of nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs on hemostasis in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Platelet function is impaired by nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) with prominent anti - inflammatory properties .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their safety in patients undergoing intracranial surgery is under debate .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) were randomized to receive either ketoprofen , 100 mg , three times a day ( ketoprofen group , n = 9 )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
or a weak NSAID , acetaminophen , 1 g , three times a day ( acetaminophen group , n = 9 ) starting immediately after the diagnosis of aneurysmal SAH
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Treatment was continued for 3 days postoperatively .
O O O O O O O O
Test blood samples were taken before treatment and surgery as well as on the first , third , and fifth postoperative mornings .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Maximal platelet aggregation induced by 6 microM of adenosine diphosphate decreased after administration of ketoprofen .
O O O O O O O O B I O O O O B O
Aggregation was lower ( P < . 05 ) in the ketoprofen group than in the acetaminophen group just before surgery and on the third postoperative day .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , maximal platelet aggregation increased in the acetaminophen group on the third postoperative day as compared with the pretreatment platelet aggregation results ( P < . 05 )
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
One patient in the ketoprofen group developed a postoperative intracranial hematoma .
O O O O B O O O O O O O
Coagulation ( prothrombin time [ PT ] , activated partial thromboplastin time [ APPT ] , fibrinogen concentration , and antithrombin III
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
[ AT III ] ) was comparable between the two groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ketoprofen but not acetaminophen impaired platelet function in patients with SAH .
B O O B O O O O O O O O
If ketoprofen is used before surgery on cerebral artery aneurysms , it may pose an additional risk factor for hemorrhage .

Value of methylprednisolone in prevention of the arthralgia - myalgia syndrome associated with the total dose infusion of iron dextran : a double blind randomized trial .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
The safety and efficacy of total dose infusion ( TDI ) of iron dextran has been well documented .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
In 40 % of treated patients , an arthralgia - myalgia syndrome develops .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The purpose of this randomized , double - blind , prospective study was to investigate whether intravenous ( i . v . ) administration of methylprednisolone ( MP ) prevents
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O
this complication .
O O O
Sixty - five patients , 34 women and 31 men , ages 36 to 80 years , received either normal saline before and after TDI ( group 1 ) ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
125 mg i . v .
O O O O O O
MP before and saline after TDI ( group 2 ) , or 125 mg i . v .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
MP before and after TDI ( group 3 ) .
B O O O O O O O O O
Patients were observed for 72 hours and reactions were recorded and graded according to severity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fifty - eight percent of group 1 patients , 33 % of group 2 , and 26 % of group 3 had reactions to TDI .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The severity of reactions ( minimal , mild , and moderate , respectively ) was as follows : group 1 - - 6 , 6 , and 2 ; group
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 - - 1 , 5 , and 0 ; group 3 - - 5 , 1 , and 0 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Data were analyzed by the two - sided Fisher 's exact test using 95 % confidence intervals with the approximation of Woolf .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These data demonstrate that administration of MP before and after TDI reduces the frequency and severity of the arthralgia - myalgia syndrome .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We conclude that 125 mg i . v .
O O O O O O O O O
MP should be given routinely before and after TDI of iron dextran .

Long - term effects of vincristine on the peripheral nervous system .
O O O O O B O O O O O O
Forty patients with Non - Hodgkin 's Lymphoma treated with vincristine between 1984 and 1990 ( cumulative dose 12 mg in 18 - 24 weeks ) were investigated in order
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to evaluate the long term effects of vincristine on the peripheral nervous system .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The patients were interviewed with emphasis on neuropathic symptoms .
O O O O O O O O O O
Physical and quantitative sensory examination with determination of vibratory perception and thermal discrimination thresholds were performed , four to 77 months ( median 34 months ) after vincristine treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Twenty - seven patients reported neuropathic symptoms .
O O O O O O O O
In 13 of these 27 patients symptoms were still present at the time of examination .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In these patients sensory signs and symptoms predominated .
O O O O O O O O O
In the other 14 patients symptoms had been present in the past .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Symptoms persisted maximally 40 months since cessation of therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O
There was no age difference between patients with and without complaints at the time of examination .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Normal reflexes were found in two third of patients .
O O O O O O O O O O
Neuropathic complaints were not very troublesome on the long term .
O O O O O O O O O O O
It is concluded that with the above mentioned vincristine dose schedule signs and symptoms of vincristine neuropathy are reversible for a great deal and prognosis is fairly good .

A case of polymyositis in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis treated with D - penicillamine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
Although D - penicillamine has been used for many rheumatologic diseases , toxicity limits its usefulness in many patients .
O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Polymyositis / dermatomyositis can develop as one of the autoimmune complications of D - penicillamine treatment , but its exact pathogenesis remains unclear .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
We report a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis , who developed polymyositis while receiving D - penicillamine therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
We described the special clinical course of the patient .
O O O O O O O O O O
Patients receiving D - penicillamine therapy should be followed carefully for the development of autoimmune complications like polymyositis / dermatomyositis .

Photodistributed nifedipine - induced facial telangiectasia .
O B O O O O O
Five months after starting nifedipine ( Adalat ) , two patients developed photodistributed facial telangiectasia , which became more noticeable with time .

Nephrotoxicity of cyclosporin A and FK506 : inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase .
O O B I O B O O O O O O
Cyclosporin A ( CsA ; 50 mg / kg ) and Fujimycine ( FK506 ; 5 mg / kg ) , but not the related macrolide immunosuppressant rapamycin ( 5
B I O B O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O
mg / kg ) , caused a reduction of glomerular filtration rate , degenerative changes of proximal tubular epithelium , and hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in male Wistar rats
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when given for 10 days .
O O O O O O
The molecular mechanisms of CsA and FK506 toxicity were investigated .
O O O O B O B O O O O
Cyclophilin A and FK506 - binding protein , the main intracytoplasmic receptors for CsA and FK506 , respectively , were each detected in renal tissue extract .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O
In the kidney , high levels of immunoreactive and enzymatically active calcineurin were found which were inhibited by the immunosuppressants CsA and FK506 , but not by rapamycin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O B O
Finally , specific immunophilin - drug - calcineurin complexes formed only in the presence of CsA and FK506 , but not rapamycin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O B O
These results suggest that the nephrotoxic effects of CsA and FK506 is likely mediated through binding to renal immunophilin and inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase .

Anti - carcinogenic action of phenobarbital given simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine in the rat .
O O O O O B O O O B O O O O
The present work has been planned in order to elucidate the effect of phenobarbital ( PB : 15 mg per rat of ingested dose ) on carcinogenesis when it is
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
administered simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine ( DEN : 10 mg / kg / day ) .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O
Wistar rats ( 180 g ) were treated by DEN alone or by DEN + PB during 2 , 4 and 6 weeks according to our schedule for hepatocarcinogenesis .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After the end of the treatment , the number and the size of induced PAS positive preneoplastic foci was significantly reduced when PB was given simultaneously with DEN for 4
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O
and 6 weeks .
O O O O
The mitotic inhibition and the production of micronuclei normally observed after partial hepatectomy in DEN treated rats were also significantly decreased in DEN + PB treated rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O B O O O
When the treatment last only 2 weeks , the presence of PB did not change significantly the last parameters .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
In DEN + PB treated rats , the survival was prolonged and the tumor incidence decreased as compared with the results obtained by DEN alone .
O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
It is concluded that PB , which promotes carcinogenesis when administered after the DEN treatment , reduces the carcinogen effect when given simultaneously with DEN .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O
This ' anti - carcinogen ' effect acts on the initiation as well as on the promotion of the precancerous lesions .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Biochemical investigations are in progress to obtain more information about this ' paradoxical ' PB effect .

A prospective study on the dose dependency of cardiotoxicity induced by mitomycin C .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Since 1975 mitomycin C ( MMC ) has been suggested to be cardiotoxic , especially when combined with or given following doxorubicin .
O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Data on dose dependency or incidence concerning this side effect were not known .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have initiated a prospective study to obtain some more data on these subjects .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Forty - four MMC - treated patients were studied , 37 of them could be evaluated .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All patients were studied by repeated physical examinations , chest X - rays , electro - and echocardiography and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction ( EF ) determinations .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results were evaluated per cumulative dose level .
O O O O O O O O O
One of the patients developed cardiac failure after 30 mg m - 2 MMC and only 150 mg
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
m - 2 doxorubicin .
O O O B O
The cardiac failure was predicted by a drop in EF determined during a cold pressor test .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
None of the other patients developed clinical cardiotoxicity , nor did the studied parameters change .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The literature on this subject was also reviewed .
O O O O O O O O O
Based on the combined data from the present study and the literature , we suggest that MMC - related cardiotoxicity is dose dependent , occurring at cumulative dose levels of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
30 mg m - 2 or more , mainly in patients also ( previously or simultaneously ) treated with doxorubicin .

The incidence is likely to be less than 10 % even for this risk group .

Phlorizin - induced glycosuria does not prevent gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats .
B O O O O O O B O O O O
Because rats with streptozotocin - induced diabetes mellitus ( DM ) have a high solute diuresis ( glycosuria of 10 to 12 g / day ) , we have suggested
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that this may in part be responsible for their resistance to gentamicin - induced acute renal failure ( ARF ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
The protection from gentamicin nephrotoxicity was studied in non - diabetic rats with chronic solute diuresis induced by blockage of tubular glucose reabsorption with phlorizin ( P ) .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O B O O
DM rats with mild glycosuria ( similar in degree to that of the P treated animals ) were also studied .

gentamicin alone ) and Group IV ( mild DM + gentamicin ) .

Tiapride in levodopa - induced involuntary movements .
B O B O O O O O
Tiapride , a substituted benzamide derivative closely related to metoclopramide , reduced levodopa - induced peak dose involuntary movements in 16 patients with idiopathic Parkinson 's disease .
B O O O B O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , an unacceptable increase in disability from Parkinsonism with aggravation of end - of - dose akinesia led to its cessation in 14 patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Tiapride had no effect on levodopa - induced early morning of """" off - period """" segmental dystonia .
B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results fail to support the notion that levodopa - induced dyskinesias are caused by overstimulation of a separate group of dopamine receptors .

Effects of the hippocampal deep brain stimulation on cortical epileptic discharges in penicillin - induced epilepsy model in rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
AIM :
O O
Experimental and clinical studies have revealed that hippocampal DBS can control epileptic activity , but the mechanism of action is obscure and optimal stimulation parameters are not clearly defined .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The aim was to evaluate the effects of high frequency hippocampal stimulation on cortical epileptic activity in penicillin - induced epilepsy model .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
MATERIAL AND METHODS :
O O O O
Twenty - five Sprague - Dawley rats were implanted DBS electrodes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
In group - 1 ( n = 10 ) hippocampal DBS was off and in the group - 2 ( n = 10 ) hippocampal DBS was on ( 185
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hz , 0 . 5V , 1V , 2V , and 5V for 60 sec ) following penicillin G injection intracortically .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O
In the control group hippocampal DBS was on following 8 l saline injection intracortically .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
EEG recordings were obtained before and 15 minutes following penicillin - G injection , and at 10th minutes following each stimulus for analysis in terms of frequency , amplitude ,
O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and power spectrum .
O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
High frequency hippocampal DBS suppressed the acute penicillin - induced cortical epileptic activity independent from stimulus intensity .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
In the control group , hippocampal stimulation alone lead only to diffuse slowing of cerebral bioelectrical activity at 5V stimulation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Our results revealed that continuous high frequency stimulation of the hippocampus suppressed acute cortical epileptic activity effectively without causing secondary epileptic discharges .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results are important in terms of defining the optimal parameters of hippocampal DBS in patients with epilepsy .

Neural correlates of S - ketamine induced psychosis during overt continuous verbal fluency .
O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
The glutamatergic N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia .
O O B I I I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Administered to healthy volunteers , a subanesthetic dose of the non - competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine leads to psychopathological symptoms similar to those observed in schizophrenia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
In patients with schizophrenia , ketamine exacerbates the core symptoms of illness , supporting the hypothesis of a glutamatergic dysfunction .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In a counterbalanced , placebo - controlled , double - blind study design , healthy subjects were administered a continuous subanesthetic S - ketamine infusion while differences in BOLD responses
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O
measured with fMRI were detected .
O O O O O O
During the scanning period , subjects performed continuous overt verbal fluency tasks ( phonological , lexical and semantic ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ketamine - induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ketamine elicited psychosis like psychopathology .
B O O O O O
Post - hoc t - tests revealed significant differences between placebo and ketamine for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency , while the phonological domain
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
remained unaffected .
O O O
Ketamine led to enhanced cortical activations in supramarginal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency , but not for semantic verbal fluency .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ketamine induces activation changes in healthy subjects similar to those observed in patients with schizophrenia , particularly in frontal and temporal brain regions .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our results provide further support for the hypothesis of an NMDA receptor dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia .

Dopamine is not essential for the development of methamphetamine - induced neurotoxicity .
B O O O O O O O B O O O O
It is widely believed that dopamine ( DA ) mediates methamphetamine ( METH ) - induced toxicity to brain dopaminergic neurons , because drugs that interfere with DA neurotransmission decrease
O O O O O B O B O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
toxicity , whereas drugs that increase DA neurotransmission enhance toxicity .
O O O O O O B O O O O
However , temperature effects of drugs that have been used to manipulate brain DA neurotransmission confound interpretation of the data .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Here we show that the recently reported ability of L - dihydroxyphenylalanine to reverse the protective effect of alpha - methyl - para - tyrosine on METH - induced
O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I I I I I O B O O
DA neurotoxicity is also confounded by drug effects on body temperature .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
Further , we show that mice genetically engineered to be deficient in brain DA develop METH neurotoxicity , as long as the thermic effects of METH are preserved .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O
In addition , we demonstrate that mice genetically engineered to have unilateral brain DA deficits develop METH - induced dopaminergic deficits that are of comparable magnitude on both sides of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the brain .
O O O
Taken together , these findings demonstrate that DA is not essential for the development of METH - induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity and suggest that mechanisms independent of DA warrant more intense

investigation .

The protective role of Nrf2 in streptozotocin - induced diabetic nephropathy .
O O O O O O B O O O O O
OBJECTIVE : Diabetic nephropathy is one of the major causes of renal failure , which is accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Nrf2 is the primary transcription factor that controls the antioxidant response essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here , we report our findings demonstrating a protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS :
O O O O O
We explore the protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy using human kidney biopsy tissues from diabetic nephropathy patients , a streptozotocin - induced diabetic nephropathy model in Nrf2 (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
- / - ) mice , and cultured human mesangial cells .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
The glomeruli of human diabetic nephropathy patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated Nrf2 levels .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the animal study , Nrf2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating streptozotocin - induced renal damage .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
This is evident by Nrf2 ( - / - ) mice having higher ROS production and suffering from greater oxidative DNA damage and renal injury compared with Nrf2 ( +
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
/ + ) mice .
O O O O O
Mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the Nrf2 - mediated protection against diabetic nephropathy is , at least , partially through inhibition of transforming
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
growth factor - beta1 ( TGF - beta1 ) and reduction of extracellular matrix production .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In human renal mesangial cells , high glucose induced ROS production and activated expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , activation or overexpression of Nrf2 inhibited the promoter activity of TGF - beta1 in a dose - dependent manner , whereas knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA enhanced TGF
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- beta1 transcription and fibronectin production .
O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
This work clearly indicates a protective role of Nrf2 in diabetic nephropathy , suggesting that dietary or therapeutic activation of Nrf2 could be used as a strategy to prevent or
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
slow down the progression of diabetic nephropathy .

High - dose tranexamic Acid is associated with nonischemic clinical seizures in cardiac surgical patients .
O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
In 2 separate centers , we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative convulsive seizures from 1 . 3 % to 3 . 8 % in patients having
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
undergone major cardiac surgical procedures .
O O O O O O
These events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high - dose tranexamic acid ( TXA ) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O
The purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between TXA usage and seizures after cardiac surgery .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
An in - depth chart review was undertaken in all 24 patients who developed perioperative seizures .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 11 of these patients , and all patients had a formal neurological evaluation and brain imaging studies .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Twenty - one of the 24 patients did not have evidence of new cerebral ischemic injury , but seizures were likely due to ischemic brain injury in 3 patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All patients with seizures did not have permanent neurological abnormalities .
O O O O O O O O O O O
All 24 patients with seizures received high doses of TXA intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg / kg , had a mean age of 69 . 9 years ,
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All but one patient were managed using cardiopulmonary bypass .
O O O O O O O O O O
No evidence of brain ischemic , metabolic , or hyperthermia - induced causes for their seizures was apparent .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Our results suggest that use of high - dose TXA in older patients in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass and open - chamber cardiac surgery is associated with clinical seizures in
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
susceptible patients .

Recurrent dysosmia induced by pyrazinamide .
O O O O B O
Pyrazinamide can have adverse effects such as hepatic toxicity , hyperuricemia or digestive disorders .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In rare cases , alterations in taste and smell function have been reported for pyrazinamide when combined with other drugs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
We report a case of reversible olfactory disorder related to pyrazinamide in a woman , with a positive rechallenge .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
The patient presented every day a sensation of smelling something burning 15 min after drug intake .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Dysosmia disappeared completely after pyrazinamide withdrawal and recurred after its rechallenge .

Longitudinal assessment of air conduction audiograms in a phase III clinical trial of difluoromethylornithine and sulindac for prevention of sporadic colorectal adenomas .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O
A phase III clinical trial assessed the recurrence of adenomatous polyps after treatment for 36 months with difluoromethylornithine ( DFMO ) plus sulindac or matched placebos .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O B O O O O
Temporary hearing loss is a known toxicity of treatment with DFMO , thus a comprehensive approach was developed to analyze serial air conduction audiograms .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The generalized estimating equation method estimated the mean difference between treatment arms with regard to change in air conduction pure tone thresholds while accounting for within - subject correlation due
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to repeated measurements at frequencies .
O O O O O O
Based on 290 subjects , there was an average difference of 0 . 50 dB between subjects treated with DFMO plus sulindac compared with those treated with placebo ( 95
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O
% confidence interval , - 0 . 64 to 1 . 63 dB ; P = 0 . 39 ) , adjusted for baseline values , age , and frequencies
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

In the normal speech range of 500 to 3 , 000 Hz , an estimated difference of 0 . 99 dB ( - 0 . 17 to 2 . 14
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dB ; P = 0 . 09 ) was detected .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Dose intensity did not add information to models .
O O O O O O O O O
There were 14 of 151 ( 9 . 3 % ) in the DFMO plus sulindac group and 4 of 139 ( 2 . 9 % ) in the placebo
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
group who experienced at least 15 dB hearing reduction from baseline in 2 or more consecutive frequencies across the entire range tested ( P = 0 . 02 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Follow - up air conduction done at least 6 months after end of treatment showed an adjusted mean difference in hearing thresholds of 1 . 08 dB ( - 0
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
. 81 to 2 . 96 dB ; P = 0 . 26 ) between treatment arms .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects in the DFMO plus sulindac group who experienced clinically significant hearing loss compared with the placebo group .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The estimated attributable risk of ototoxicity from exposure to the drug is 8 . 4 % ( 95 % confidence interval , - 2 . 0 % to 18 .

Increased mental slowing associated with the APOE epsilon4 allele after trihexyphenidyl oral anticholinergic challenge in healthy elderly .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVES :
O O
The objectives of this study were to examine the relationship between APOE epsilon4 and subjective effects of trihexyphenidyl on measures reflecting sedation and confusion and to investigate the relationship between
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
trihexyphenidyl - induced subjective effects and objective memory performance .
B O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :

This study comprised 24 cognitively intact , health elderly adults ( 12 APOE epsilon4 carriers ) at an outpatient geriatric psychiatry research clinic .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This was a randomized , double blind , placebo - controlled , three - way , crossover experimental design .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All participants received 1 . 0 mg or 2 . 0 mg trihexyphenidyl or placebo administered in counterbalanced sequences over a period of three consecutive weeks .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bond and Lader 's visual analog scales and alternate versions of the Buschke Selective Reminding Test were administered in a repeated measures design at baseline , 1 , 2 .

5 , and 5 hours postdrug administration .
O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
A 2 . 0 - mg oral dose of trihexyphenidyl resulted in increased subjective ratings of mental slowness in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Drug effects as determined by difference scores between 2 . 0 mg trihexyphenidyl and placebo on ratings of mental slowness significantly correlated with total and delayed recall on the Buschke
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Selective Reminding Test in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , no significant effects were found with other visual analog scales reflecting subjective sedation and clear - headedness .

Behavioral effects of pubertal anabolic androgenic steroid exposure in male rats with low serotonin .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O
The goal of this study was to assess the interactive effects of chronic anabolic androgenic steroid ( AAS ) exposure and brain serotonin ( 5 - hydroxytryptamine ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O B I I O
5 - HT ) depletion on behavior of pubertal male rats .
B I I O O O O O O O O O
Serotonin was depleted beginning on postnatal day 26 with parachlorophenylalanine ( PCPA 100 mg / kg , every other day ) ; controls received saline .
B O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At puberty ( P40 ) , half the PCPA - treated rats and half the saline - treated rats began treatment with testosterone ( T , 5 mg / kg
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
, 5 days / week ) .
O O O O O O O
Behavioral measures included locomotion , irritability , copulation , partner preference , and aggression .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Animals were tested for aggression in their home cage , both with and without physical provocation ( mild tail pinch ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Brain levels of 5 - HT and its metabolite , 5 - hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( 5 - HIAA ) , were determined using HPLC .
O O O B I I O O O O B I I I O B I I O O O O O O O
PCPA significantly and substantially depleted 5 - HT and 5 - HIAA in all brain regions examined .
B O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O
Chronic T treatment significantly decreased 5 - HT and 5 - HIAA in certain brain areas , but to a much lesser extent than PCPA .
O B O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Chronic exposure to PCPA alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased irritability but had no effect on sexual behavior , partner preference , or aggression .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
T alone had no effect on locomotion , irritability , or sexual behavior but increased partner preference and aggression .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The most striking effect of combining T + PCPA was a significant increase in attack frequency as well as a significant decrease in the latency to attack , particularly following
O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
physical provocation .
O O O
Based on these data , it can be speculated that pubertal AAS users with low central 5 - HT may be especially prone to exhibit aggressive behavior .

Intracavitary chemotherapy ( paclitaxel / carboplatin liquid crystalline cubic phases ) for recurrent glioblastoma - - clinical observations .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Human malignant brain tumors have a poor prognosis in spite of surgery and radiation therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cubic phases consist of curved biocontinuous lipid bilayers , separating two congruent networks of water channels .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Used as a host for cytotoxic drugs , the gel - like matrix can easily be applied to the walls of a surgical resection cavity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For human glioblastoma recurrences , the feasibility , safety , and short - term effects of a surgical intracavitary application of paclitaxel and carboplatin encapsulated by liquid crystalline cubic phases
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O
are examined in a pilot study .
O O O O O O O
A total of 12 patients with a recurrence of a glioblastoma multiforme underwent re - resection and received an intracavitary application of paclitaxel and carboplatin cubic phases in different dosages
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
.

Six of the patients received more than 15 mg paclitaxel and suffered from moderate to severe brain edema , while the remaining patients received only a total of 15 mg
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
paclitaxel .
B O
In the latter group , brain edema was markedly reduced and dealt medically .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Methylphenidate - induced obsessive - compulsive symptoms in an elderly man .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
An 82 - year - old man with treatment - resistant depression and early Alzheimer 's disease was started on methylphenidate .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Significant obsessive - compulsive behavior ensued but diminished over several weeks when methylphenidate was replaced by fluvoxamine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O
The patient had no prior psychiatric history , but he had a sister with obsessive - compulsive disorder .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It appears that methylphenidate precipitated the patient 's pathological behavior .

Cardiac arrest after intravenous metoclopramide - a case of five repeated injections of metoclopramide causing five episodes of cardiac arrest .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
We describe a patient where intravenous injection of metoclopramide was immediately followed by asystole repeatedly .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The patient received metoclopramide 10 mg i . v .
O O O B O O O O O O
five times during 48 h .
O O O O O O
After interviewing the attending nurses and reviewing the written documentation , it is clear that every administration of metoclopramide was immediately ( within s ) followed by asystole .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
The asystole lasted 15 - 30 s on four occasions , on one occasion it lasted 2 min .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient received atropine 0 . 5 - 1 mg and chest compressions , before sinus rhythm again took over .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We interpret this as episodes of cardiac arrest caused by metoclopramide .
O O O O O O O O O O B O
The rapid injection via the central venous route and the concomitant tapering of dopamine infusion might have contributed in precipitating the adverse drug reaction .

Cauda equina syndrome after spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric 5 % lignocaine : a review of six cases of cauda equina syndrome reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance 1993 - 1997
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Six cases of cauda equina syndrome with varying severity were reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance during the period 1993 - 1997 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All were associated with spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric 5 % lignocaine .
O O O O O O O O O O B O
Five cases had single - shot spinal anaesthesia and one had a repeat spinal anaesthetic due to inadequate block .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The dose of hyperbaric 5 % lignocaine administered ranged from 60 to 120 mg .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Three of the cases were most likely caused by direct neurotoxicity of hyperbaric 5 % lignocaine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
In the other 3 cases , direct neurotoxicity was also probable , but unfortunately radiological investigations were not done to definitely exclude a compressive aetiology .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All cases sustained permanent neurological deficits .
O O O O O O O
We recommend that hyperbaric lignocaine should be administered in concentrations not greater than 2 % and at a total dose preferably not exceeding 60 mg .

Cortical motor overactivation in parkinsonian patients with L - dopa - induced peak - dose dyskinesia .
O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
We have studied the regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) changes induced by the execution of a finger - to - thumb opposition motor task in the supplementary and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
primary motor cortex of two groups of parkinsonian patients on L - dopa medication , the first one without L - dopa induced dyskinesia ( n = 23 ) and
O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
the other with moderate peak - dose dyskinesia ( n = 15 ) , and of a group of 14 normal subjects .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Single photon emission tomography with i . v .
O O O O O O O O O
133Xe was used to measure the rCBF changes .
O O O O O O O O O
The dyskinetic parkinsonian patients exhibited a pattern of response which was markedly different from those of the normal subjects and non - dyskinetic parkinsonian patients , with a significant overactivation
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the supplementary motor area and the ipsi - and contralateral primary motor areas .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results are compatible with the hypothesis that an hyperkinetic abnormal involuntary movement , like L - dopa - induced peak dose dyskinesia , is due to a disinhibition of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pallidothalamocortical motor loop .

Dexamethasone - induced ocular hypertension in perfusion - cultured human eyes .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
PURPOSE :
O O
Glucocorticoid administration can lead to the development of ocular hypertension and corticosteroid glaucoma in a subset of the population through a decrease in the aqueous humor outflow facility .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The purpose of this study was to determine whether glucocorticoid treatment can directly affect the outflow facility of isolated , perfusion - cultured human eyes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
The anterior segments of human donor eyes from regional eye banks were placed in a constant flow , variable pressure perfusion culture system .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Paired eyes were perfused in serum - free media with or without 10 ( - 7 )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
M dexamethasone for 12 days .
O B O O O O
Intraocular pressure was monitored daily .
O O O O O O
After incubation , the eyes were morphologically characterized by light microscopy , transmission and scanning electron microscopy , and scanning laser confocal microscopy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
A significant increase in intraocular pressure developed in 13 of the 44 pairs of eyes perfused with dexamethasone with an average pressure rise of 17 . 5 + / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 . 8 mm Hg after 12 days of dexamethasone exposure .
O O O O O O O O O B O O
The contralateral control eyes , which did not receive dexamethasone , maintained a stable intraocular pressure during the same period .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
The outflow pathway of the untreated eyes appeared morphologically normal .
O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , the dexamethasone - treated hypertensive eyes had thickened trabecular beams , decreased intertrabecular spaces , thickened juxtacanalicular tissue , activated trabecular meshwork cells , and increased amounts
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of amorphogranular extracellular material , especially in the juxtacanalicular tissue and beneath the endothelial lining of the canal of Schlemm .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The dexamethasone - treated nonresponder eyes appeared to be morphologically similar to the untreated eyes , although several subtle dexamethasone - induced morphologic changes were evident .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Dexamethasone treatment of isolated , perfusion - cultured human eyes led to the generation of ocular hypertension in approximately 30 % of the dexamethasone - treated eyes .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Steroid treatment resulted in morphologic changes in the trabecular meshwork similar to those reported for corticosteroid glaucoma and open angle glaucoma .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This system may provide an acute model in which to study the pathogenic mechanisms involved in steroid glaucoma and primary open angle glaucoma .

Cognitive deterioration from long - term abuse of dextromethorphan : a case report .

Dextromethorphan ( DM ) , the dextrorotatory isomer of 3 - hydroxy - N - methylmorphinan , is the main ingredient in a number of widely available , over -
B O B O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the - counter antitussives .
O O O O O
Initial studies ( Bornstein 1968 ) showed that it possessed no respiratory suppressant effects and no addiction liability .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Subsequently , however , several articles reporting abuse of this drug have appeared in the literature .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The drug is known to cause a variety of acute toxic effects , ranging from nausea , restlessness , insomnia , ataxia , slurred speech and nystagmus to mood changes
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, perceptual alterations , inattention , disorientation and aggressive behavior ( Rammer et al 1988 ;
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Katona and Watson 1986 ; Isbell and Fraser 1953 ; Devlin et al 1985 ; McCarthy 1971 ; Dodds and Revai 1967 ; Degkwitz 1964 ; Hildebrand et al 1989

Long - term lithium treatment and the kidney .
O O O B O O O O O
Interim report on fifty patients .
O O O O O O
This is a report on the first part of our study of the effects of long - term lithium treatment on the kidney .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Creatinine clearance , maximum urinary osmolality and 24 hour urine volume have been tested in 50 affectively ill patients who have been on long - term lithium for more than
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
one year .
O O O
These findings have been compared with norms and with values of the same tests from screening prior to lithium , available for most of our patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
No evidence was found for any reduction of glomerular filtration during lithium treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Low clearance values found in several patients could be accounted for by their age and their pre - lithium values .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Urinary concentration defect appeared frequent but the extent of the impairment is difficult to assess because of the uncertainty about the norms applicable to this group of patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The concentration defect appeared reversible , at least in part .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Polyuria above 3 litres / 24 hours was found in 10 % of patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An attempt is made to draw practical conclusions from the preliminary findings .

O O O O O O O O B O
Forty minutes after receiving a single starting dose of trazodone , a patient developed complete heart block .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
The case illustrates that , despite the results of earlier studies , trazodone 's effect on cardiac conduction may be severe in individuals at risk for conduction delay .

The epidemiology of the acute flank pain syndrome from suprofen .
O O O O O O O O O B O
Suprofen , a new nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug , was marketed in early 1986 as an analgesic agent .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Until physicians began reporting an unusual acute flank pain syndrome to the spontaneous reporting system , 700 , 000 persons used the drug in the United States .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Through August 1986 , a total of 163 cases of this syndrome were reported .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To elucidate the epidemiology of the syndrome , a case - control study was performed , comparing 62 of the case patients who had been reported to the spontaneous reporting
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
system to 185 suprofen - exposed control subjects who did not have the syndrome .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Case patients were more likely to be men ( odds ratio , 3 . 8 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 2 - 12 . 1 ) ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
suffer from hay fever and asthma ( odds ratio , 3 . 4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 0 - 11 . 9 ) ; to participate
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in regular exercise ( odds ratio , 5 . 9 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 1 - 30 . 7 ) , especially in the use of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nautilus equipment ( p = 0 . 02 ) ; and to use alcohol ( odds ratio , 4 . 4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 1
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- 17 . 5 ) .
O O O O O O
Possible risk factors included young age , concurrent use of other analgesic agents ( especially ibuprofen ) , preexisting renal disease , a history of kidney stones , a history
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of gout , a recent increase in activity , a recent increase in sun exposure , and residence in the Sunbelt .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These were findings that were suggestive but did not reach conventional statistical significance .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings are consistent with the postulated mechanism for this unusual syndrome : acute diffuse crystallization of uric acid in renal tubules .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
Hemolytic - uremic syndrome associated with ingestion of quinine .
O O O O O O O O B O
Hemolytic - uremic syndrome following quinine ingestion is a newly described phenomenon , with just two previous descriptions of 4 cases in the literature .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We describe a 5th case .
O O O O O O
The reaction may be mediated by the presence of antibodies reactive against platelets in the presence of quinine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Treatment has included use of plasma exchange , prednisone , aspirin , and dipyridamole .
O O O O O O O O B O B O O B O
The patients have all regained some degree of renal function .
O O O O O O O O O O O
However , it is unclear whether pharmacological treatment or spontaneous resolution is responsible for the improvement .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Quinine - associated hemolytic - uremic syndrome probably occurs more often than is recognized .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is important to recognize this reaction when it occurs and to avoid further quinine exposure , since the reaction seems to be recurrent .

Pyeloureteral filling defects associated with systemic anticoagulation : a case report .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The etiology of pyeloureteritis cystica has long been attributed to chronic infection and inflammation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A case is presented that is unique in that the acute onset and the rapid resolution of pyeloureteral filling defects in this patient were documented by radiography .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There is no evidence of antecedent or concurrent infection in this patient .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The disease occurred subsequent to the initiation of heparin therapy for suspected pelvic thrombophlebitis and cleared rapidly subsequent to its discontinuation .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The rate of resolution of the radiographic findings may be helpful in distinguishing between true pyeloureteritis cystica and submucosal hemorrhage .

Changes in peroxisomes in preneoplastic liver and hepatoma of mice induced by alpha - benzene hexachloride .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
Peroxisomes in hepatomas and hyperplastic preneoplastic liver lesions induced in mice by 500 ppm alpha - benzene hexachloride were examined histochemically and electron microscopically .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O
Although most of the hepatomas were well - differentiated tumors and contained a considerable number of peroxisomes , the tumor cells did not respond to
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ethyl - alpha - p - chlorophenoxyisobutyrate with proliferation of peroxisomes .
B I I I I I I O O O O O
At the 16th week of carcinogen feeding , hyperplastic nodules appeared and advanced to further stages .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A majority of the nodules showed a considerable number of peroxisomes and the inductive proliferation of peroxisomes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Within the nodules , foci of proliferation of the cells that showed no inducibility of proliferation of peroxisomes appeared .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These cells proliferated further , replacing the most part of the nodules , and with this process hepatomas appeared to have been formed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No abnormal matrical inclusions of peroxisomes were formed in the cells of hyperplastic nodules by ethyl - alpha - p - chlorophenoxyisobutyrate unlike in the case of rats .

Quinidine hepatitis .
B O O
Long - term administration of quinidine was associated with persistent elevation of serum concentrations of SGOT , lactic acid dehydrogenase , and alkaline phosphatase .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
Liver biopsy showed active hepatitis .
O O O O O O
Discontinuance of quinidine therapy led to normalization of liver function tests .
O O B O O O O O O O O O
A challenge dose of quinidine caused clinical symptoms and abrupt elevation of SGOT , alkaline phosphatase , and lactic acid dehydrogenase values .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O
We concluded that this patient had quinidine hepatotoxicity and believe that this is the first case reported with liver biopsy documentation .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This report also suggests that , even after long - term administration , the hepatic toxicity is reversible .

Cholesteryl hemisuccinate treatment protects rodents from the toxic effects of acetaminophen , adriamycin , carbon tetrachloride , chloroform and galactosamine .
B I O O O O O O O O B O B O B I O B O B O
In addition to its use as a stabilizer / rigidifier of membranes , cholesteryl hemisuccinate , tris salt ( CS ) administration has also been shown to protect rats from
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O
the hepatotoxic effects of carbon tetrachloride ( CCl4 ) .
O O O O B I O B O O
To further our understanding of the mechanism of CS cytoprotection , we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of CS and the non - hydrolyzable ether form of
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
CS , gamma - cholesteryloxybutyric acid , tris salt ( CSE ) against acetaminophen - , adriamycin - , carbon tetrachloride - , chloroform - and galactosamine - induced toxicity
B O B I I I O B I O B O O B O O B O O B I O O B O O B O O O
.
O
The results of these studies demonstrated that CS - mediated protection is not selective for a particular species , organ system or toxic chemical .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 24 - h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of CS ( 100mg / kg , i . p . )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
, resulted in significant protection against the hepatotoxic effects of CCl4 , CHCl3 , acetaminophen and galactosamine and against the lethal ( and presumably cardiotoxic ) effect of adriamycin administration
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O
.
O
Maximal CS - mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insult .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These data suggest that CS intervenes in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to toxic cell death .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mechanism of CS protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate ( in light of the protection observed against
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
galactosamine hepatotoxicity ) .
B O O O
However , based on the data presented , we can not exclude the possibility that CS administration inhibits chemical bioactivation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Our findings do suggest that CS - mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic CS molecule ( non - hydrolyzable CSE was as protective as
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O
CS ) , whose mechanism has yet to be defined .

diagnosed multiple myeloma ( MM ) .
O O O O O O O
Thirty patients were treated with three 21 - day cycles of bortezomib 1 . 3 mg / m ( 2 ) on days 1 , 4 , 8 , and
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

m ( 2 ) on day 1 .
O O O O O O O O
The maximum tolerated dose of cyclophosphamide was defined as 900 mg / m ( 2 ) .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
At this dose level , 92 % of patients achieved at least a partial response .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The overall response rate [ complete response ( CR ) plus partial response ( PR ) ]

No patient experienced progressive disease .
O O O O O O
The most frequent adverse events were hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities as well as neuropathy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results suggest that bortezomib in combination with cyclophosphamide at 900 mg / m ( 2 ) and dexamethasone is an effective induction treatment for patients with newly diagnosed MM

Leucocytoclastic vasculitis presents as palpable purpura of the lower extremities often accompanied by abdominal pain , arthralgia , and renal involvement .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Etiologic factors or associated disorders include infections , medications , collagen vascular disease and neoplasia .

Naloxazone pretreatment modifies cardiorespiratory , temperature , and behavioral effects of morphine .
B O O O O O O O O O O B O
Behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to a lethal dose of morphine were evaluated in rats pretreated with saline or naloxazone , an antagonist of high - affinity mu 1 opioid receptors
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
.

Dexrazoxane protects against myelosuppression from the DNA cleavage - enhancing drugs etoposide and daunorubicin but not doxorubicin .
B O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O B O
PURPOSE :
O O
The anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin and the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide are potent DNA cleavage - enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology ; however , myelosuppression and cardiac toxicity
O B B O B O O B B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
limit their use .

Dexrazoxane ( ICRF - 187 ) is recommended for protection against anthracycline - induced cardiotoxicity .
B O B I I O O O O O O B O O O O
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN :
O O O
Because of their widespread use , the hematologic toxicity following coadministration of dexrazoxane and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated : Sensitivity of human and murine blood
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
progenitor cells to etoposide , daunorubicin , and doxorubicin + / -
O O O B O B O O B O O O
dexrazoxane was determined in granulocyte - macrophage colony forming assays .
B O O O O O O O O O O
Likewise , in vivo , B6D2F1 mice were treated with etoposide , daunorubicin , and doxorubicin , with or without dexrazoxane over a wide range of doses : posttreatment ,
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
a full hematologic evaluation was done .
O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay ; however , dexrazoxane neither reduced
O O O B O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
myelosuppression , weight loss , nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Although our findings support the observation that dexrazoxane reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically , the potent antagonism of daunorubicin activity raises concern ; a possible
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O
interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Our data also suggest that significant etoposide dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of dexrazoxane .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O
Clinical trials in patients with brain metastases combining dexrazoxane and high doses of etoposide is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating hematologic toxicity .

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sublethal hypercapnia immediately before the acquisition session ; ( 2 ) partial ( rats ) or complete ( mice ) prevention of the scopolamine - induced short - term amnesia
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
for a passive avoidance task ; ( 3 ) complete protection against amnesia for a passive avoidance task in rats submitted to electroconvulsive shock immediately after avoidance acquisition ; (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 ) prevention of the long - term retention - or retrieval - deficit for a passive avoidance task induced in rats and mice by chloramphenicol or cycloheximide administered immediately
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O
after acquisition ; ( 5 ) reversal , when administered as late as 1 h before the retention test , of the deficit in retention or retrieval of a passive
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
avoidance task induced by cycloheximide injected 2 days previously ; ( 6 ) prevention of the deficit in the retrieval of an active avoidance task induced in mice by subconvulsant
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
electroshock or hypercapnia applied immediately before retrieval testing ( 24 h after acquisition ) .

These improvements or normalizations of impaired cognitive functions were seen at oral aniracetam doses of 10 - 100 mg / kg .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Generally , the dose - response curves were bell - shaped .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mechanisms underlying the activity of aniracetam and its ' therapeutic window ' are unknown .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Piracetam , another pyrrolidinone derivative was used for comparison .
B O O B O O O O O O
It was active only in six of nine tests and had about one - tenth the potency of aniracetam .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The results indicate that aniracetam improves cognitive functions which are impaired by different procedure and in different phases of the learning and memory process .

Nicotine potentiation of morphine - induced catalepsy in mice .
B O O B O O O O O O
In the present study , effects of nicotine on catalepsy induced by morphine in mice have been investigated .
O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O
Morphine but not nicotine induced a dose - dependent catalepsy .
B O O B O O O O O O O
The response of morphine was potentiated by nicotine .
O O O B O O O B O
Intraperitoneal administration of atropine , naloxone , mecamylamine , and hexamethonium to mice reduced catalepsy induced by a combination of morphine with nicotine .
O O O B O B O B O O B O O O O O O O O O B O B O
Intracerebroventricular injection of atropine , hexamethonium , and naloxone also decreased catalepsy induced by morphine plus nicotine .
O O O B O B O O B O O O O O B O B O
Intraperitoneal administration of atropine , but not intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection of hexamethonium , decreased the effect of a single dose of morphine .
O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O
It was concluded that morphine catalepsy can be elicited by opioid and cholinergic receptors , and the potentiation of morphine induced by nicotine may also be mediated through cholinergic receptor

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PATIENTS AND METHODS :
O O O O
Two hundred ninety - seven patients with MBC and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomized to receive either 60 mg / m ( 2 ) of Myocet (
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O

O O O O O
Cardiotoxicity was defined by reductions in left - ventricular ejection fraction , assessed by serial multigated radionuclide angiography scans , or congestive heart failure ( CHF ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Antitumor efficacy was assessed by objective tumor response rates ( World Health Organization criteria ) , time to progression , and survival .

Protective effect of a specific platelet - activating factor antagonist , BN 52021 , on bupivacaine - induced cardiovascular impairments in rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B O O O O O O O
Administration of the local anaesthetic bupivacaine ( 1 . 5 or 2 mg / kg , i . v . ) to rats elicited a marked decrease of mean arterial
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
blood pressure ( MBP ) and heart rate ( HR ) leading to death ( in 67 % or 90 % of animals respectively ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Intravenous injection of the specific platelet - activating factor ( PAF ) antagonist BN 52021 ( 10 mg / kg ) , 30 min before bupivacaine administration ( 2 mg
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
/ kg i . v . ) suppressed both the decrease of MBP and HR .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , doses of 1 mg / kg BN 52021 given 30 min before or 10 mg / kg administered 5 min before i . v .
O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
injection of bupivacaine were ineffective .
O O B O O O
When BN 52021 ( 20 mg / kg i . v . ) was injected immediately after bupivacaine ( 2 mg / kg ) , a partial reversion of the
O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
decrease of MBP and HR was observed , whereas the dose of 10 mg / kg was ineffective .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A partial recovery of bupivacaine - induced ECG alterations was observed after pretreatment of the rats with BN 52021 .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Since the administration of BN 52021 , at all doses studied , did not alter MBP and HR at the doses used , the bulk of these results clearly demonstrate
O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a protective action of BN 52021 , a specific antagonist of PAF , against bupivacaine - induced cardiovascular toxicity .
O O O O B I O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Thus , consistent with its direct effect on heart , PAF appears to be implicated in bupivacaine - induced cardiovascular alterations .

( Urd ) have been reported to reduce , in vitro , azidothymidine ( AZT ) - induced inhibition of human granulocyte - macrophage progenitor cells without impairment of its
O B O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
antihuman immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) activity .
O O O O O O O O
Because of the clinical toxicities associated with chronic Urd administration , the ability of benzylacyclouridine ( BAU ) to effect , in vivo , AZT - induced anemia and leukopenia
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O
was assessed .

This agent inhibits Urd catabolism and , in vivo , increases the plasma concentration of Urd in a dose - dependent manner , without Urd - related toxicity .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O
In mice rendered anemic and leukopenic by the administration of AZT for 28 days in drinking water ( 1 . 5 mg / mL ) , the continued administration of
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
AZT plus daily BAU ( 300 mg / kg , orally ) partially reversed AZT - induced anemia and leukopenia ( P less than . 05 ) , increased peripheral
B O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
reticulocytes ( to 4 . 9 % , P less than . 01 ) , increased cellularity in the marrow , and improved megaloblastosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When coadministered with AZT from the onset of drug administration , BAU reduced AZT - induced marrow toxicity .
O O O B O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
In vitro , at a concentration of 100 mumol / L , BAU possesses minimal anti - HIV activity and has no effect on the ability of AZT to reverse

Cyclophosphamide - induced cystitis in freely - moving conscious rats : behavioral approach to a new model of visceral pain .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PURPOSE :
O O
To develop a model of visceral pain in rats using a behavioral approach .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cyclophosphamide ( CP ) , an antitumoral agent known to produce toxic effects on the bladder wall through its main toxic metabolite acrolein , was used to induce cystitis .
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
MATERIALS AND METHODS :
O O O O
CP was administered at doses of 50 , 100 and 200 mg . / kg .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i . p .
O O O O
to male rats , and their behavior observed and scored .
O O O O O O O O O O O
The effects of morphine ( 0 . 5 to 4 mg . / kg . i . v . ) on CP - induced behavioral modifications were tested administered alone
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
and after naloxone ( 1 mg . / kg . s . c . ) .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , 90 minutes after CP injection , that is , at the time of administration of morphine , the bladder was removed in some rats for histological examination
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Finally , to show that the bladder is essential for the CP - induced behavioral modifications , female rats also received CP at doses of 200 mg . / kg
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
.

i . p .
O O O O
and of 20 mg .
O O O O O
by the intravesical route , and acrolein at doses of 0 . 5 mg .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
by the intravesical route and of 5 mg . / kg . i . v .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
CP dose - relatedly induced marked behavioral modifications in male rats : breathing rate decrease , closing of the eyes and occurrence of specific postures .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Morphine dose - dependently reversed these behavioral disorders .
B O O O O O O O O
A dose of 0 . 5 mg . / kg . produced a reduction of almost 50 % of the behavioral score induced by CP 200 mg . / kg
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
.
O
This effect was completely prevented by pretreatment with naloxone .
O O O O O O O O B O
At the time of administration of morphine , histological modifications of the bladder wall , such as chorionic and muscle layer edema , were observed .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In female rats , CP 200 mg . / kg .
O O O O B O O O O O O
i . p .
O O O O
produced the same marked behavioral modifications as those observed in male rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Administered at the dose of 20 mg .
O O O O O O O O
intravesically , CP did not produce any behavioral effects , whereas acrolein at 0 . 5 mg .
O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
intravesically induced behavioral modifications identical to those under CP 200 mg . / kg .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
i . p .
O O O O
, with the same maximal levels .
O O O O O O O
Conversely , acrolein 5 mg . / kg . i . v . did not produce any behavioral effects at all .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Overall , these results indicate that this experimental model of CP - induced cystitis may be an interesting new behavioral model of inflammatory visceral pain , allowing a better understanding
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of these painful syndromes and thus a better therapeutic approach to them .

Hyperalgesia and myoclonus in terminal cancer patients treated with continuous intravenous morphine .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Eight cancer patients in the terminal stages of the disease treated with high doses of intravenous morphine developed hyperalgesia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
All cases were retrospectively sampled from three different hospitals in Copenhagen .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Five patients developed universal hyperalgesia and hyperesthesia which in 2 cases were accompanied by myoclonus .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 3 patients a pre - existing neuralgia increased to excruciating intensity and in 2 of these cases myoclonus occurred simultaneously .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although only few clinical descriptions of the relationship between hyperalgesia / myoclonus and high doses of morphine are available , experimental support from animal studies indicates that morphine , or
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O
its metabolites , plays a causative role for the observed behavioural syndrome .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The possible mechanisms are discussed and treatment proposals given suggesting the use of more efficacious opioids with less excitatory potency in these situations .

A prospective study of adverse reactions associated with vancomycin therapy .
O O O O O O O O B O O
A prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of vancomycin was conducted in 54 consecutive patients over a 16 - month period .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Vancomycin was curative in 95 % of 43 patients with proven infection .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Drugs were ceased in six patients because of adverse reactions ; in three of these vancomycin was considered the likely cause .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Reactions included thrombophlebitis ( 20 of 54 patients ) , rash ( 4 of 54 ) , nephrotoxicity ( 4 of 50 ) , proteinuria ( 1 of 50 )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and ototoxicity ( 1 of 11 patients tested by audiometry ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thrombophlebitis occurred only with infusion through peripheral cannulae ; nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were confined to patients receiving an aminoglycoside plus vancomycin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
We conclude that vancomycin , administered appropriately , constitutes safe , effective therapy for infections caused by susceptible bacteria .

Dextran - etodolac conjugates : synthesis , in vitro and in vivo evaluation .
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Etodolac ( E ) , is a non - narcotic analgesic and antiinflammatory drug .
B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
A biodegradable polymer dextran has been utilized as a carrier for synthesis of etodolac - dextran conjugates ( ED ) to improve its aqueous solubility and reduce gastrointestinal side effects
O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
An activated moiety , i . e . N - acylimidazole derivative of etodolac ( EAI ) , was condensed with the polysaccharide polymer dextran of different molecular weights (
O O O O O O O O B I I O O B O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
40000 , 60000 , 110000 and 200000 ) .
O O O O O O O O O
IR spectral data confirmed formation of ester bonding in the conjugates .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
Etodolac contents were evaluated by UV - spectrophotometric analysis .
B O O O O O O O O O
The molecular weights were determined by measuring viscosity using the Mark - Howink - Sakurada equation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In vitro hydrolysis of ED was done in aqueous buffers ( pH 1 . 2 , 7 . 4 , 9 ) and in 80 % ( v / v

Hypersensitivity myocarditis complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy heart .
O O O O O O O
The present report describes a case of eosinophilic myocarditis complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The 47 - year - old female patient , known to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , was admitted with biventricular failure and managed aggressively with dobutamine infusion and other drugs while
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
being assessed for heart transplantation .
O O O O O O
On transthoracic echocardiogram , she had moderate left ventricular dysfunction with regional variability and moderate mitral regurgitation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The recipient 's heart showed the features of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myocarditis with abundant eosinophils .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Myocarditis is rare and eosinophilic myocarditis is rarer .
O O O O O O O O O
It is likely that the hypersensitivity ( eosinophilic ) myocarditis was related to dobutamine infusion therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Eosinophilic myocarditis has been reported with an incidence of 2 . 4 % to 7 . 2 % in explanted hearts and may be related to multidrug therapy .

All - trans - retinoic acid - induced erythema nodosum in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia .
B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
Erythema nodosum associated with all - trans - retinoic acid ( ATRA ) for acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) is very rare .
O O O O B I I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
We describe four patients with classic APL who developed erythema nodosum during ATRA therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Fever and subsequent multiple painful erythematous nodules over extremities developed on D11 , D16 , D17 , and D19 , respectively , after ATRA therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
The skin biopsy taken from each patient was consistent with erythema nodosum .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All patients received short course of steroids .
O O O O O O B O
Fever subsided rapidly and the skin lesions regressed completely .
O O O O O O O O O O
All patients achieved complete remission without withdrawal of ATRA .
O O O O O O O O B O
ATRA seemed to be the most possible etiology of erythema nodosum in our patients .

Delayed - onset heparin - induced thrombocytopenia .
O O O B O O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Heparin - induced thrombocytopenia presents 5 to 12 days after heparin exposure , with or without arterial or venous thromboemboli .
B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Delayed recognition and treatment of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia contribute to poor patient outcomes .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To describe and increase awareness of a clinical scenario in which the onset or manifestations of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia are delayed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
DESIGN :
O O
Retrospective case series .
O O O O
SETTING :
O O
Three large urban hospitals ( with active cardiovascular surgery programs ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
PATIENTS :
O O
14 patients seen over a 3 - year period in whom heparin - induced thrombocytopenia became apparent on delayed presentation with thromboembolic complications .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
MEASUREMENTS :
O O
Platelet counts , onset of objectively determined thromboembolism , results of heparin - induced platelet factor 4 antibody tests , and outcomes .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Patients went home after hospitalizations that had included heparin exposure - - in most cases , with no thrombocytopenia recognized - - only to return to the hospital ( median
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, day 14 ) with thromboembolic complications .
O O O O O O O O
Thromboemboli were venous ( 12 patients , 7 with pulmonary emboli ) or arterial ( 4 patients ) or both .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Platelet counts were mildly decreased in all but 2 patients on second presentation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On readmission , 11 patients received therapeutic heparin , which worsened the patients ' clinical condition and , in all 11 cases , decreased the platelet count ( mean at
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
readmission , 143 x 10 ( 9 ) cells / L ; mean nadir after heparin re - exposure , 39 x 10 ( 9 ) cells / L )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Results of serologic tests for heparin - induced antibodies were positive in all patients .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Subsequent treatments included alternative anticoagulants ( 11 patients ) , thrombolytic drugs ( 3 patients ) , inferior vena cava filters ( 3 patients ) and , eventually ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
warfarin ( 11 patients ) .
B O O O O O
Three patients died .
O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Delayed - onset heparin - induced thrombocytopenia is increasingly being recognized .
O O O B O O O O O O O O
To avoid disastrous outcomes , physicians must consider heparin - induced thrombocytopenia whenever a recently hospitalized patient returns with thromboembolism ; therapy with alternative anticoagulants , not heparin , should
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O

Valsartan , a new angiotensin II antagonist for the treatment of essential hypertension : a comparative study of the efficacy and safety against amlodipine .
B O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To compare the antihypertensive efficacy of a new angiotensin II antagonist , valsartan , with a reference therapy , amlodipine .
O O O O O O O O B I O O B O O O O O O B O
METHODS :
O O
One hundred sixty - eight adult outpatients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly allocated in double - blind fashion and equal number to receive 80 mg valsartan or 5
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
mg amlodipine for 12 weeks .
O B O O O O
After 8 weeks of therapy , in patients whose blood pressure remained uncontrolled , 5 mg amlodipine was added to the initial therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Patients were assessed at 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Secondary variables included change in sitting systolic blood pressure and responder rates .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Both valsartan and amlodipine were effective at lowering blood pressure at 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks .
O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Similar decreases were observed in both groups , with no statistically significant differences between the groups for any variable analyzed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For the primary variable the difference was 0 . 5 mm Hg in favor of valsartan ( p = 0 . 68 ; 95 % confidence interval , - 2
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
. 7 to 1 . 7 ) .
O O O O O O O O
Responder rates at 8 weeks were 66 . 7 % for valsartan and 60 . 2 % for amlodipine ( p = 0 . 39 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Both treatments were well tolerated .
O O O O O O
The incidence of drug - related dependent edema was somewhat higher in the amlodipine group , particularly at a dose of 10 mg per day ( 2 . 4 %
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for 80 mg valsartan ; 3 . 6 % for 5 mg amlodipine ; 0 % for valsartan plus 5 mg amlodipine ; 14 . 3 % for 10 mg
O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O
amlodipine ) .
B O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
The data show that valsartan is at least as effective as amlodipine in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension .
O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
The results also show valsartan to be well tolerated and suggest that it is not associated with side effects characteristic of this comparator class , dihydropyridine calcium antagonists .

KF17837 : a novel selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist with anticataleptic activity .
B O O O O B O O O O O O O
KF17837 is a novel selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist .
B O O O O B O O O O
Oral administration of KF17837 ( 2 . 5 , 10 . 0 and 30 . 0 mg / kg ) significantly ameliorated the cataleptic responses induced by intracerebroventricular administration of
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
an adenosine A2A receptor agonist , CGS 21680 ( 10 micrograms ) , in a dose - dependent manner .
O B O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
KF17837 also reduced the catalepsy induced by haloperidol ( 1 mg / kg i . p . ) and by reserpine ( 5 mg / kg i . p .
B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
) .
O O
These anticataleptic effects were exhibited dose dependently at doses from 0 . 625 and 2 . 5 mg / kg p . o . , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Moreover , KF17837 ( 0 . 625 mg / kg p . o . )
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
potentiated the anticataleptic effects of a subthreshold dose of L - 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylalanine ( L - DOPA ; 25 mg / kg i . p . )
O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
plus benserazide ( 6 . 25 mg / kg i . p . ) .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results suggested that KF17837 is a centrally active adenosine A2A receptor antagonist and that the dopaminergic function of the nigrostriatal pathway is potentiated by adenosine A2A receptor antagonists .
O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Furthermore , KF17837 may be a useful drug in the treatment of parkinsonism .

Some central effects of repeated treatment with fluvoxamine .
O O O O O O O B O
We investigated the effect of repeated treatment with fluvoxamine , a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor , on behavioral effects of dopaminomimetics and methoxamine and on the animal behavior in the
O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
"""" behavioral despair """" test .
O O O O O O
A repeated treatment with fluvoxamine ( twice daily for 14 days ) potentiated in mice and in rats ( weaker ) the amphetamine - induced hyperactivity .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The hyperactivity induced by nomifensine in mice remained unaffected by fluvoxamine .
O O O O B O O O O O B O
The stimulation of locomotor activity by intracerebroventricularly administered methoxamine was not affected by repeated treatment with fluvoxamine .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O
Given three times fluvoxamine had no effect on the immobilization time in the """" behavioral despair """" test in rats .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results indicate that fluvoxamine given repeatedly acts differently than citalopram , another selective serotonin uptake inhibitor , and differs also from other antidepressant drugs .

Severe congestive heart failure patient on amiodarone presenting with myxedemic coma : a case report .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
This is a case report of myxedema coma secondary to amiodarone - induced hypothyroidism in a patient with severe congestive heart failure ( CHF ) .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To our knowledge and after reviewing the literature there is one case report of myxedema coma during long term amiodarone therapy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Myxedema coma is a life threatening condition that carries a mortality reaching as high as 20 % with treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The condition is treated with intravenous thyroxine ( T4 ) or intravenous tri - iodo - thyronine ( T3 ) .
O O O O O O B O B O O O B I I I I O B O O
Patients with CHF on amiodarone may suffer serious morbidity and mortality from hypothyroidism , and thus may deserve closer follow up for thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) levels .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This case report carries an important clinical application given the frequent usage of amiodarone among CHF patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The myriad clinical presentation of myxedema coma and its serious morbidity and mortality stresses the need to suspect this clinical syndrome among CHF patients presenting with hypotension , weakness or
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other unexplained symptoms .

Fear - potentiated startle , but not light - enhanced startle , is enhanced by anxiogenic drugs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES : The light - enhanced startle paradigm ( LES ) is suggested to model anxiety , because of the non - specific cue and the long -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
term effect .
O O O
In contrast , the fear - potentiated startle ( FPS ) is suggested to model conditioned fear .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , the pharmacological profiles of these two paradigms are very similar .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The present study investigated the effects of putative anxiogenic drugs on LES and FPS and aimed at determining the sensitivity of LES for anxiogenic drugs and to potentially showing a
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pharmacological differentiation between these two paradigms .
O O O O O O O
METHODS :
O O
Male Wistar rats received each dose of the alpha ( 2 ) - adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine ( 0 . 25 - 1 . 0mg / kg ) , the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 - HT ( 2C ) receptor agonist m - chlorophenylpiperazine ( mCPP , 0 . 5 - 2 . 0mg / kg ) or the GABA ( A )
B I I O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
inverse receptor agonist pentylenetetrazole ( PTZ , 3 - 30mg / kg ) and were subsequently tested in either LES or FPS .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
None of the drugs enhanced LES , whereas mCPP increased percentage FPS and yohimbine increased absolute FPS values .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O
Furthermore , yohimbine increased baseline startle amplitude in the LES , while mCPP suppressed baseline startle in both the LES and FPS and PTZ suppressed baseline startle in the FPS
O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
.
O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
In contrast to findings in the FPS paradigm , none of the drugs were able to exacerbate the LES response .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , a clear pharmacological differentiation was found between LES and FPS .

Proteinase 3 - antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody - ( PR3 - ANCA ) positive necrotizing glomerulonephritis after restarting sulphasalazine treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
A 59 - year - old woman with ulcerative colitis developed red eyes , pleural effusion , eosinophilia and urinary abnormalities after restarting of sulphasalazine treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Light microscopy of a kidney biopsy revealed segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis without deposition of immunoglobulin or complement .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Proteinase 3 - antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( PR3 - ANCA ) titer was elevated at 183 ELISA units ( EU ) in sera ( normal range less than 10 EU
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) , myeloperoxidase - ANCA was negative .
O O O O O O O O
PR3 - ANCA titer was 250 and 1 , 070 EU in pleural effusions on right and left side , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although cessation of sulphasalazine treatment resulted in improvements in fever , red eyes , chest pain , titer of C - reactive protein and volume of the pleural effusions ,
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we initiated steroid therapy , because PR3 - ANCA titer rose to 320 EU , eosinophil count increased to 1 , 100 cells / microl , and the pleural effusion
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
remained .
O O
One month after steroid therapy , the pleural effusion disappeared , and PR3 - ANCA titer normalized 3 months later .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This case suggests that sulphasalazine can induce PR3 - ANCA - positive necrotizing glomerulonephritis .

Following phenytoin administration , the patient developed acute severe bradycardia , refractory to atropine and adrenaline .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
The cardiac depressant actions of phenytoin and hypothermia can be additive .
O O O O O B O O O O O O
Administration of phenytoin in the presence of hypothermia may lead to an adverse cardiac event in children .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As phenytoin is a commonly used drug , clinicians need to be aware of this interaction .

Amisulpride related tic - like symptoms in an adolescent schizophrenic .
B O O O O O O O O O O
Tic disorders can be effectively treated by atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone , olanzapine and ziprasidone .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O
However , there are two case reports that show tic - like symptoms , including motor and phonic variants , occurring during treatment with quetiapine or clozapine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
We present a 15 - year - old girl schizophrenic who developed frequent involuntary eye - blinking movements after 5 months of amisulpride treatment ( 1000 mg per day )
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
.
O
The tic - like symptoms resolved completely after we reduced the dose of amisulpride down to 800 mg per day .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
However , her psychosis recurred after the dose reduction .
O O O O O O O O O O
We then placed her on an additional 100 mg per day of quetiapine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
She has been in complete remission under the combined medications for more than one year and maintains a fair role function .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No more tic - like symptoms or other side effects have been reported .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Together with previously reported cases , our patient suggests that tic - like symptoms might occur in certain vulnerable individuals during treatment with atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine ,

Comparison of developmental toxicology of aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid ) in rats using selected dosing paradigms .
O O O O O B O B I O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND :

Analysis of the literature for nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) suggests that a low incidence of developmental anomalies occurs in rats given NSAIDs on specific days during
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
organogenesis .

O O O O O O O O O O
There are no published ASA studies using the multiple dosing paradigm of GDs 6 to 17 .

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of low incidence malformations with ASA when a multiple dosing paradigm is used .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O

The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce ventricular septal defects ( VSDs ) and midline defects ( MDs ) in rats and diaphragmatic hernia ( DH ) , MDs ,
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and VSDs in rabbits ( Cook JC et al . , 2003 ) ; hence , the present study focused on these malformations , even though ASA induces several other
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
low - incidence malformations .
O O O O O
In single dose studies , DH , MD , and VSD were induced on GDs 9 and 10 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
VSD also was noted following treatment on GD 11 .
O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , DH and MD were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high - dose group , and VSD was noted across all dose groups

CONCLUSIONS :
O O
High concordance in major developmental anomalies between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of VSD in the SD rats and hydrocephalus in the Wistar rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Variations and malformations were similar when ASA was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis ( GDs 6 to 17 ) .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was also evident that , by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose , malformations that normally occur at low incidence , as reported from previous single
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dose studies , could also be induced with ASA given at multiple doses .

Torsade de pointes induced by metoclopramide in an elderly woman with preexisting complete left bundle branch block .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
There is a growing list of drugs implicated in acquired long QT syndrome and torsade de pointes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , the torsadogenic potential of metoclopramide , a commonly used antiemetic and prokinetic drug , has not been reported in the literature , despite its chemical similarity to
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
procainamide .
B O
We report on a 92 - year - old woman with preexisting complete left bundle branch block who developed torsade de pointes after intravenous and oral administration of metoclopramide .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
This patient also developed torsade de pointes when cisapride and erythromycin were given simultaneously .
O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O
These two episodes were suppressed successfully after discontinuing the offending drugs and administering class IB drugs .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is the first documentation that metoclopramide provokes torsade de pointes clinically .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Metoclopramide should be used cautiously in patients with a risk of torsade de pointes .

Apomorphine : an underutilized therapy for Parkinson 's disease .
B O O O O O O O O O
Apomorphine was the first dopaminergic drug ever used to treat symptoms of Parkinson 's disease .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951 , the potential of treating fluctuating Parkinson 's disease by subcutaneous administration of apomorphine has only recently become the
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
subject of systematic study .
O O O O O
A number of small scale clinical trials have unequivocally shown that intermittent subcutaneous apomorphine injections produce antiparkinsonian benefit close if not identical to that seen with levodopa and that
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
apomorphine rescue injections can reliably revert off - periods even in patients with complex on - off motor swings .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions can reduce daily off - time by more than 50 % in this group of patients , which appears to be a stronger effect than that
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
generally seen with add - on therapy with oral dopamine agonists or COMT inhibitors .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Extended follow - up studies of up to 8 years have demonstrated long - term persistence of apomorphine efficacy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
In addition , there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting levodopa - induced dyskinesias .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The main side effects of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems , whereas sedation and psychiatric complications play a lesser role .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Given the marked degree of efficacy of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment in fluctuating Parkinson 's disease , this approach seems to deserve more widespread clinical use .

Fatal excited delirium following cocaine use :
O O O O B O O
epidemiologic findings provide new evidence for mechanisms of cocaine toxicity .
O O O O O O O O B O O
We describe an outbreak of deaths from cocaine - induced excited delirium ( EDDs ) in Dade County , Florida between 1979 and 1990 .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
From a registry of all cocaine - related deaths in Dade County , Florida , from 1969 - 1990 , 58 EDDs were compared with 125 victims of accidental
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cocaine overdose without excited delirium .
B O O O O O
Compared with controls , EDDs were more frequently black , male , and younger .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were less likely to have a low body mass index , and more likely to have died in police custody , to have received medical treatment immediately before death
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, to have survived for a longer period , to have developed hyperthermia , and to have died in summer months .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
EDDs had concentrations of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in autopsy blood that were similar to those for controls .
O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O
The epidemiologic findings are most consistent with the hypothesis that chronic cocaine use disrupts dopaminergic function and , when coupled with recent cocaine use , may precipitate agitation , delirium
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
, aberrant thermoregulation , rhabdomyolysis , and sudden death .

Heparin - induced thrombocytopenia , thrombosis , and hemorrhage .
B O O O O O O O O O
Sixty - two patients with a heparin - induced thrombocytopenia are reported .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Clinical manifestations of this disorder include hemorrhage or , more frequently , thromboembolic events in patients receiving heparin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Laboratory testing has revealed a falling platelet count , increased resistance to heparin , and aggregation of platelets by the patient 's plasma when heparin is added .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Immunologic testing has demonstrated the presence of a heparin - dependent platelet membrane antibody .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The 20 deaths , 52 hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications , and 21 surgical procedures to manage the complications confirm the seriousness of the disorder .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Specific risk factors have not been identified ; therefore , all patients receiving heparin should be monitored .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
If the platelet count falls to less than 100 , 000 / mm3 , while the patient is receiving heparin , platelet aggregation testing , using the patient 's plasma
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
, is indicated .
O O O O
Management consists of cessation of heparin , platelet anti - aggregating agents , and alternate forms of anticoagulation when indicated .

Cardiac toxicity of 5 - fluorouracil .
O O O B I I O
Report of a case of spontaneous angina .
O O O O O O O O
We report a case of a patient with colon carcinoma and liver metastasis who presented chest pain after 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) administration .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O
Clinical electrocardiographic evolution was similar to that observed in Prinzmetal 's angina , and chest pain promptly resolved with nifedipine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
These data suggest that coronary spasm may be the cause of cardiotoxicity due to 5 - FU , and that calcium antagonists may probably be used in the prevention or
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O B O O O O O O O O O
treatment of 5 - FU cardiotoxicity .

Association with HLA - B35 and Cw4 antigens .
O O O O O O O O O
Twenty - five patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) who developed toxicity while taking remission inducing drugs and 30 without toxicity were studied for possible associations with class I
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and II HLA antigens .
O O O O O
A strong association has been found between nephritis and dermatitis due to Tiopronin ( a D - Penicillamine like compound ) and class I antigens B35 - Cw4 , and
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
between dermatitis due to gold thiosulphate and B35 .
O O O O B B O O O
Compared to healthy controls a lower DR5 frequency was observed in patients with RA except for the Tiopronin related nephritis group .

O O O O O
Among the common side effects of diphenylhydantoin ( DPH ) overdose , the most frequently encountered neurological signs are those of cerebellar dysfunction .
O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Very rarely , the toxic neurological manifestations of this drug are of cerebral origin .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two patients are presented who suffered progressive hemiparesis due to DPH overdose .

Nerve growth factor and prostaglandins in the urine of female patients with overactive bladder .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
PURPOSE :
O O
NGF and PGs in the bladder can be affected by pathological changes in the bladder and these changes can be detected in urine .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We investigated changes in urinary NGF and PGs in women with OAB .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O
MATERIALS AND METHODS :
O O O O
The study groups included 65 women with OAB and 20 without bladder symptoms who served as controls .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Evaluation included patient history , urinalysis , a voiding diary and urodynamic studies .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Urine samples were collected .
O O O O O
NGF , PGE2 , PGF2alpha
O O B O B
and PGI2 were measured using enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay and compared between the groups .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , correlations between urinary NGF and PG , and urodynamic parameters in patients with OAB were examined .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Urinary NGF , PGE2 and PGF2alpha were significantly increased in patients with OAB compared with controls ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , urinary PGI2 was not different between controls and patients with OAB .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
In patients with OAB urinary PGE2 positively correlated with volume at first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity ( p < 0 . 05 ) .

NGF and PGs have important roles in the development of OAB symptoms in female patients .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Urinary levels of these factors may be used as markers to evaluate OAB symptoms .

Acute low back pain during intravenous administration of amiodarone : a report of two cases .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Amiodarone represents an effective antiarrhythmic drug for cardioversion of recent - onset atrial fibrillation ( AF ) and maintenance of sinus rhythm .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Postoperative myalgia after succinylcholine : no evidence for an inflammatory origin .
O O O B O O O O O O O O
A common side effect associated with succinylcholine is postoperative myalgia .
O O O O O O B O O O O
The pathogenesis of this myalgia is still unclear ; inflammation has been suggested but without convincing evidence .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We designed the present study to investigate whether an inflammatory reaction contributes to this myalgia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The incidence and severity of succinylcholine - associated myalgia was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or dexamethasone before succinylcholine ( n = 32 for each ) .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O
Incidence and severity of myalgia did not differ significantly between the two groups : 15 patients in the dexamethasone group complained of myalgia compared with 18 patients in the saline
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
group , and severe myalgia was reported by five patients and three patients , respectively ( not significant ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At 48 h after surgery , 12 patients in both groups still suffered from myalgia ( not significant ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) as an early marker of inflammation was assessed in a subgroup of 10 patients pretreated with saline .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We found an increase of IL - 6 for only three patients , but only one patient reported myalgia ; no relationship between myalgia and the increase of IL -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
6 was found .
O O O O
In conclusion , there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of succinylcholine - associated myalgia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
IMPLICATIONS :
O O
Administration of dexamethasone before succinylcholine was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of succinylcholine - induced postoperative myalgia .
O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Furthermore , there was no significant relationship between postoperative myalgia and time course of interleukin - 6 concentrations , a marker of inflammation .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pretreatment with dexamethasone is not justified to prevent postoperative myalgia after succinylcholine .

Protective effect of edaravone against streptomycin - induced vestibulotoxicity in the guinea pig .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O
This study investigated alleviation of streptomycin - induced vestibulotoxicity by edaravone in guinea pigs .
O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O
Edaravone , a free radical scavenger , has potent free radical quenching action and is used in clinical practice to treat cerebral infarction .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Streptomycin was administered to the inner ear by osmotic pump for 24 h , and edaravone ( n = 8 ) or saline ( n = 6 ) was intraperitoneally
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
injected once a day for 7 days .
O O O O O O O O
We observed horizontal vestibulo - ocular reflex as a marker of postoperative vestibular function .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Animals injected with saline showed statistically smaller gains than those injected with edaravone .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
These results suggest that edaravone suppresses streptomycin - induced vestibulotoxicity .

Ketamine in war / tropical surgery ( a final tribute to the racemic mixture ) .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A technique of continuous intravenous anaesthesia with ketamine was used successfully during the Somalia civil war in 1994 and in north Uganda in 1999 for 64 operations in 62 patients
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, aged from 6 weeks to 70 years , undergoing limb and abdominal surgery including caesarian sections and interventions in neonates .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Operations lasting up to 2h could be performed in the absence of sophisticated equipment such as pulse oximeters or ventilators in patients on spontaneous ventilation breathing air / oxygen only
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
.

After premedication with diazepam , glycopyrrolate and local anaesthesia , and induction with standard doses of ketamine , a maintenance dose of 10 - 20 microg / kg / min
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of ketamine proved safe and effective .
O B O O O O O
Emphasis was placed on bedside clinical monitoring , relying heavily on the heart rate .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Diazepam , unless contraindicated or risky , remains the only necessary complementary drug to ketamine as it buffers its cardiovascular response and decreases the duration and intensity of operative and
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
postoperative hallucinations .
O O O
Local anaesthetic blocks were useful in decreasing the requirement for postoperative analgesia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An antisialogue was usually unnecessary in operations lasting up to 2 h , glycopyrrolate being the best choice for its lowest psychotropic and chronotropic effects , especially in a hot
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
climate .
O O
Experience in war / tropical settings suggests this technique could be useful in civilian contexts such as outdoor life - saving emergency surgery or in mass casualties where , e

Steroid structure and pharmacological properties determine the anti - amnesic effects of pregnenolone sulphate in the passive avoidance task in rats .
B O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
Pregnenolone sulphate ( PREGS ) has generated interest as one of the most potent memory - enhancing neurosteroids to be examined in rodent learning studies , with particular importance in
B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ageing process .
O O O O
The mechanism by which this endogenous steroid enhances memory formation is hypothesized to involve actions on glutamatergic and GABAergic systems .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This hypothesis stems from findings that PREGS is a potent positive modulator of N - methyl - d - aspartate receptors ( NMDARs ) and a negative modulator of
O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O
gamma - aminobutyric acid ( A ) receptors ( GABA ( A ) Rs ) .
B I I I O O O O O B O O O O O O
Moreover , PREGS is able to reverse the amnesic - like effects of NMDAR and GABA ( A ) R ligands .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
To investigate this hypothesis , the present study in rats examined the memory - altering abilities of structural analogs of PREGS , which differ in their modulation of NMDAR and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
/ or GABA ( A ) R function .
O O B O O O O O O
The analogs tested were : 11 - ketopregnenolone sulphate ( an agent that is inactive at GABA ( A ) Rs and NMDARs ) ,
O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
epipregnanolone ( [ 3beta - hydroxy - 5beta - pregnan - 20 - one ] sulphate , an inhibitor of both GABA ( A ) Rs and NMDARs ) ,
B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
and a newly synthesized ( - ) PREGS enantiomer ( which is identical to PREGS in effects on GABA ( A ) Rs and NMDARs ) .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O
The memory - enhancing effects of PREGS and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of scopolamine - induced amnesia .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Both PREGS and its ( - ) enantiomer blocked the effects of scopolamine .
O B O O O O O O O O O O B O
The results show that , unlike PREGS , 11 - ketopregnenolone sulphate and epipregnanolone sulphate failed to block the effect of scopolamine , suggesting that altering the modulation of
O O O O O O B O B I I I O B I O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
NMDA receptors diminishes the memory - enhancing effects of PREGS .
B O O O O O O O O B O
Moreover , enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural PREGS to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing scopolamine - induced amnesia .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
These results identify a novel neuropharmacological site for the modulation of memory processes by neuroactive steroids .

Preliminary efficacy assessment of intrathecal injection of an American formulation of adenosine in humans .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
BACKGROUND :
O O
Preclinical studies of intrathecal adenosine suggest it may be effective in the treatment of acute and chronic pain in humans , and preliminary studies in volunteers and patients with a
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Swedish formulation of adenosine suggests it may be effective in hypersensitivity states but not with acute noxious stimulation .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The purpose of this study was to screen for efficacy of a different formulation of adenosine marketed in the US , using both acute noxious stimulation and capsaicin - evoked
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
mechanical hypersensitivity .
O O O
METHODS :
O O
Following Food and Drug Administration and institutional review board approval and written informed consent , 65 volunteers were studied in two trials : an open - label , dose -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
escalating trial with intrathecal adenosine doses of 0 . 25 - 2 . 0 mg and a double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of adenosine , 2 mg
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
.
O
Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis , and pain ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia after intradermal capsaicin injection were determined
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
.
O
RESULTS :
O O
Adenosine produced no effect on pain report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia from intradermal capsaicin injection for at least 24 h .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
In contrast , residence time of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid was short ( < 4 h ) .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
These results show selective inhibition by intrathecal adenosine of hypersensitivity , presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral capsaicin injection .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
The long - lasting effect is consistent with that observed in preliminary reports of patients with chronic neuropathic pain and is not due to prolonged residence of adenosine in cerebrospinal

Systemic toxicity following administration of sirolimus ( formerly rapamycin ) for psoriasis : association of capillary leak syndrome with apoptosis of lesional lymphocytes .
O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND : Sirolimus ( formerly rapamycin ) is an immunosuppressive agent that interferes with T - cell activation .
O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After 2 individuals with psoriasis developed a capillary leak syndrome following treatment with oral sirolimus lesional skin cells and activated peripheral blood cells were analyzed for induction of apoptosis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
OBSERVATIONS :
O O
A keratome skin specimen from 1 patient with sirolimus - induced capillary leak syndrome had a 2 . 3 - fold increase in percentage of apoptotic cells ( to 48
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
% ) compared with an unaffected sirolimus - treated patient with psoriasis ( 21 % ) .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Activated peripheral blood T cells from patients with psoriasis tended to exhibit greater spontaneous or dexamethasone - induced apoptosis than did normal T cells , particularly in the presence of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sirolimus .
B O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Severe adverse effects of sirolimus include fever , anemia , and capillary leak syndrome .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
These symptoms may be the result of drug - induced apoptosis of lesional leukocytes , especially activated T lymphocytes , and possibly release of inflammatory mediators .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because patients with severe psoriasis may develop capillary leak from various systemic therapies , clinical monitoring is advisable for patients with inflammatory diseases who are treated with immune modulators .

Contribution of the glycine site of NMDA receptors in rostral and intermediate - caudal parts of the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone in rats .
O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of the glycine site of NMDA receptors in the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Muscle tone was examined using a combined mechanoand electromyographic method , which measured simultaneously the muscle resistance ( MMG ) of the rat 's hind foot to passive extension and

a group of 45 patients with inoperable lung cancer under treatment with IF ( 2250 mg / m2 on days 2 - 5 ) as part of a polychemotherapy regimen
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Out of a total of 88 courses of this treatment we observed 10 episodes of asymptomatic microscopic haematuria and no episodes of gross haematuria .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this group of 45 patients under protection with MESNA there were 5 complete remissions and 9 partial remissions ( total 31 % ) .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A further group of 25 patients under polychemotherapy with IF were treated by conventional prophylactic measures ( raised fluid intake and forced diuresis ) .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this group there were 1 complete and 5 partial remissions ( total 24 % ) , but nearly all patients developed either gross haematuria and / or symptoms of

bladder irritation ( cystitis and pollakisuria ) .
O O O O O O O O
There were no appreciable differences between the MESNA series and the conventional prophylaxis series with respect to either haematological or systemic toxicity of the cytostatic treatment .

Dexmedetomidine , acting through central alpha - 2 adrenoceptors , prevents opiate - induced muscle rigidity in the rat .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The highly - selective alpha - 2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine ( D - MED ) is capable of inducing muscle flaccidity and anesthesia in rats and dogs .
O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Intense generalized muscle rigidity is an undesirable side effect of potent opiate agonists .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although the neurochemistry of opiate - induced rigidity has yet to be fully elucidated , recent work suggests a role for a central adrenergic mechanism .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the present study , the authors determined if treatment with D - MED prevents the muscle rigidity caused by high - dose alfentanil anesthesia in the rat .

O O O O O
Baseline electromyographic activity was recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle before and after drug treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Each rat was then injected with alfentanil ( ALF , 0 . 5 mg / kg sc ) .
O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O
ALF injection resulted in a marked increase in hindlimb EMG activity in the L - MED treatment group which was indistinguishable from that seen in animals treated with saline .

In contrast , D - MED prevented alfentanil - induced muscle rigidity in a dose - dependent fashion .

Delayed institution of hypertension during focal cerebral ischemia : effect on brain edema .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The effect of induced hypertension instituted after a 2 - h delay following middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO ) on brain edema formation and histochemical injury was studied .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Under isoflurane anesthesia , the MCA of 14 spontaneously hypertensive rats was occluded .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the control group ( n = 7 ) , the mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) was not manipulated .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the hypertensive group ( n = 7 ) , the MAP was elevated by 25 - 30 mm Hg beginning 2 h after MCAO .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Four hours after MCAO , the rats were killed and the brains harvested .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of ischemia produced by MCAO .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Specific gravity ( SG ) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex ( core and periphery of the ischemic territory ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The extent of neuronal injury was determined by 2 , 3 , 5 - triphenyltetrazolium staining .
O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O
In the ischemic core , there was no difference in SG in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the periphery of the ischemic territory , SG in the cortex was greater ( less edema accumulation ) in the hypertensive group ( 1 . 041 + / -

0 . 001 , P less than 0 . 05 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The area of histochemical injury ( as a percent of the cross - sectional area of the hemisphere ) was less in the hypertensive group ( 33 + / -

O O O O O O O O O O O
The data indicate that phenylephrine - induced hypertension instituted 2 h after MCAO does not aggravate edema in the ischemic core , that it improves edema in the periphery of
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ischemic territory , and that it reduces the area of histochemical neuronal dysfunction .

Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity .
B O O O
Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent whose utility is limited by many side - effects , the most problematic being pneumonitis .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The pulmonary toxicity of amiodarone is thought to result from direct injury related to the intracellular accumulation of phospholipid and T cell - mediated hypersensitivity pneumonitis .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The clinical and radiographic features of amiodarone - induced pulmonary toxicity are characteristic but nonspecific .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
The diagnosis depends on exclusion of other entities , such as heart failure , infection , and malignancy .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While withdrawal of amiodarone leads to clinical improvement in majority of cases , this is not always possible or advisable .

phytomitogen ( PHA - P ) .
O O O O O O O
as well as of those of seven other tuberculous patients .

This last finding may be related to time of testing and / or endogenous serum binding of rifampin which could have inhibited mitogen activity for the lymphocyte .

Initial potassium loss and hypokalaemia during chlorthalidone administration in patients with essential hypertension : the influence of dietary sodium restriction .
O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
To investigate the initial potassium loss and development of hypokalaemia during the administration of an oral diuretic , metabolic balance studies were performed in ten patients with essential hypertension who
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
had shown hypokalaemia under prior oral diuretic treatment .
O O O O O O O O O
Chlorthalidone ( 50 mg daily ) was given for 14 days .

Six patients received a normal - sodium diet and four a low - sodium ( 17 mmol / day ) diet .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
All patients had a normal initial total body potassium ( 40 K ) .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
The electrolyte balances , weight , bromide space , plasma renin activity , and aldosterone secretion rate were measured .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
In both groups a potassium deficit developed , with proportionally larger losses from the extracellular than from the intracellular compartment .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the normal - sodium group the highest mean potassium deficit was 176 mmol on day 9 , after which some potassium was regained ; in the low -
O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
sodium group the highest deficit was 276 mmol on day 13 .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
The normal - sodium group showed an immediate but temporary rise of the renin and aldosterone levels ; in the low - sodium group renin and aldosterone increased more slowly
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O B O O O
but remained elevated .
O O O O
It is concluded that dietary sodium restriction increases diuretic - induced potassium loss , presumably by an increased activity of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system , while
O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O
sodium delivery to the distal renal tubules remains sufficiently high to allow increased potassium secretion .

Dynamic response of blood vessel in acute renal failure .
O O O O O O O O O O
In this study we postulated that during acute renal failure induced by gentamicin the transient or dynamic response of blood vessels could be affected , and that antioxidants can prevent
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the changes in dynamic responses of blood vessels .
O O O O O O O O O
The new approach to ex vivo blood vessel experiments in which not only the end points of vessels response within the time interval is considered , but also dynamics of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this response , was used in this paper .

Our results confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin - treated animals .

The hemodynamics of oxytocin and other vasoactive agents during neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery : findings in six cases .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Oxytocin is a commonly used uterotonic that can cause significant and even fatal hypotension , particularly when given as a bolus .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The resulting hypotension can be produced by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output through a decrease in venous return .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Parturients with normal volume status , heart valves and pulmonary vasculature most often respond to this hypotension with a compensatory increase in heart rate and stroke volume .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Oxytocin - induced hypotension at cesarean delivery may be incorrectly attributed to blood loss .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pulse power analysis ( also called """" pulse contour analysis """" ) of an arterial pressure wave form allows continuous evaluation of systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output in real
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
time , thereby elucidating the causative factors behind changes in blood pressure .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pulse power analysis was conducted in six cases of cesarean delivery performed under neuraxial anesthesia .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hypotension in response to oxytocin was associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a compensatory increase in stroke volume , heart rate and cardiac output .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pulse power analysis may be helpful in determining the etiology of and treating hypotension during cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia .

Exaggerated expression of inflammatory mediators in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide knockout ( VIP - / - ) mice with cyclophosphamide ( CYP ) - induced cystitis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP ) is an immunomodulatory neuropeptide distributed in micturition pathways .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
VIP ( - / - ) mice exhibit altered bladder function and neurochemical properties in micturition pathways after cyclophosphamide ( CYP ) - induced cystitis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
Given VIP 's role as an anti - inflammatory mediator , we hypothesized that VIP ( - / - ) mice would exhibit enhanced inflammatory mediator expression after cystitis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A mouse inflammatory cytokine and receptor RT2 profiler array was used to determine regulated transcripts in the urinary bladder of wild type ( WT ) and VIP ( - /
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- ) mice with or without CYP - induced cystitis ( 150 mg / kg ; i . p .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
; 48 h ) .
O O O O O
Four binary comparisons were made :
O O O O O O
WT control versus CYP treatment ( 48 h ) , VIP ( - / - ) control versus CYP treatment ( 48 h ) , WT control versus VIP (
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
- / - ) control , and WT with CYP treatment ( 48 h ) versus VIP ( - / - ) with CYP treatment ( 48 h ) .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The genes presented represent ( 1 ) greater than 1 . 5 - fold change in either direction and ( 2 ) the p value is less than 0 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
05 for the comparison being made .
O O O O O O O
Several regulated genes were validated using enzyme - linked immunoassays including IL - 1beta and CXCL1 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CYP treatment significantly ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) increased expression of CXCL1 and IL - 1beta in the urinary bladder of WT and VIP ( -
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
/ - ) mice , but expression in VIP ( - / -
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
) mice with CYP treatment was significantly ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) greater ( 4 . 2 - to 13 - fold increase ) than that
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
observed in WT urinary bladder ( 3 . 6 - to 5 - fold increase ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The data suggest that in VIP ( - / - ) mice with bladder inflammation , inflammatory mediators are increased above that observed in WT with CYP .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
This shift in balance may contribute to increased bladder dysfunction in VIP ( - / - ) mice with bladder inflammation and altered neurochemical expression in micturition pathways .

O O O O O O O O B I O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To report the incidence and management of elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) in patients with uveitis treated with the fluocinolone acetonide ( FA ) intravitreal implant .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O
DESIGN :

- mg or 2 . 1 - mg FA intravitreal implant or standard therapy were analyzed .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
During the 3 - year follow - up , 71 . 0 % of implanted eyes had an IOP increase of 10 mm Hg or more than baseline and 55
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
. 1 % , 24 . 7 % , and 6 . 2 % of eyes reached an IOP of 30 mm Hg or more , 40 mm Hg or
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
more , and 50 mm Hg or more , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O O
Topical IOP - lowering medication was administered in 74 . 8 % of implanted eyes , and IOP - lowering surgeries , most of which were trabeculectomies ( 76 .

2 % ) , were performed on 36 . 6 % of implanted eyes .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Intraocular pressure - lowering surgeries were considered a success ( postoperative IOP of 6 - 21 mm Hg with or without additional IOP - lowering medication ) in 85 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 % of eyes at 1 year .
O O O O O O O O
The rate of hypotony ( IOP < / = 5 mm Hg ) following IOP - lowering surgery ( 42 . 5 % ) was not different from that of
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
implanted eyes not subjected to surgery ( 35 . 4 % ) ( P = . 09 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Elevated IOP is a significant complication with the FA intravitreal implant but may be controlled with medication and surgery .

Pallidal stimulation : an alternative to pallidotomy ?
O O O O O O O O
A resurgence of interest in the surgical treatment of Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) came with the rediscovery of posteroventral pallidotomy by Laitinen in 1985 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Laitinen 's procedure improved most symptoms in drug - resistant PD , which engendered wide interest in the neurosurgical community .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Another lesioning procedure , ventrolateral thalamotomy , has become a powerful alternative to stimulate the nucleus ventralis intermedius , producing high long - term success rates and low morbidity rates
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Pallidal stimulation has not met with the same success .
O O O O O O O O O O
According to the literature pallidotomy improves the """" on """" symptoms of PD , such as dyskinesias , as well as the """" off """" symptoms , such as rigidity
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, bradykinesia , and on - off fluctuations .
O O O O O O O O O
Pallidal stimulation improves bradykinesia and rigidity to a minor extent ; however , its strength seems to be in improving levodopa - induced dyskinesias .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Stimulation often produces an improvement in the hyper - or dyskinetic upper limbs , but increases the """" freezing """" phenomenon in the lower limbs at the same time .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Considering the small increase in the patient 's independence , the high costs of bilateral implants , and the difficulty most patients experience in handling the devices , the question
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
arises as to whether bilateral pallidal stimulation is a real alternative to pallidotomy .

Case report : Dexatrim ( Phenylpropanolamine ) as a cause of myocardial infarction .
O O O B O B O O O O O O O O
Phenylpropanolamine ( PPA ) is a sympathetic amine used in over - the - counter cold remedies and weight - control preparations worldwide .
B O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Its use has been associated with hypertensive episodes and hemorrhagic strokes in younger women .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Several reports have linked the abuse of PPA with myocardial injury , especially when overdose is involved .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
We report here the first case of Dexatrim ( PPA ) - induced myocardial injury in a young woman who was using it at recommended doses for weight control .
O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , we review the 7 other cases of PPA related myocardial injury that have been reported so far .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Physicians and patients should be alert to the potential cardiac risk associated with the use of PPA , even at doses generally considered to be safe .

Risperidone - associated , benign transient visual disturbances in schizophrenic patients with a past history of LSD abuse .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Two schizophrenic patients , who had a prior history of LSD abuse and who had previously developed EPS with classic antipsychotics , were successfully treated with risperidone .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
They both reported short episodes of transient visual disturbances , which appeared immediately after starting treatment with risperidone .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
This imagery resembled visual disturbances previously experienced as """" flashbacks """" related to prior LSD consumption .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Risperidone administration was continued and the visual disturbances gradually wore off .
B O O O O O O O O O O O
During a six - month follow - up period , there was no recurrence of visual disturbances .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This phenomenon may be interpreted as a benign , short - term and self - limiting side effect which does not contraindicate the use of risperidone or interfere with treatment
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O

Conclusions based on two case reports should be taken with appropriate caution .

Activation of poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase contributes to development of doxorubicin - induced heart failure .
O O B I I I I I O O O O O B O O O O O
Activation of the nuclear enzyme poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) by oxidant - mediated DNA damage is an important pathway of cell dysfunction and tissue
O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
injury in conditions associated with oxidative stress .
O O O O O O O O
Increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin ( DOX ) , a widely used antitumor anthracycline antibiotic .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O B O O
Thus , we hypothesized that the activation of PARP may contribute to the DOX - induced cardiotoxicity .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Using a dual approach of PARP - 1 suppression , by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phenanthridinone PARP inhibitor PJ34 , we now demonstrate the role of PARP
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
in the development of cardiac dysfunction induced by DOX . PARP - 1 + / + and PARP - 1 - / - mice received a single injection of
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DOX ( 25 mg / kg i . p ) .
B O O O O O O O O O O
Five days after DOX administration , left ventricular performance was significantly depressed in PARP - 1 + / + mice , but only to a smaller extent in PARP -
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 - / - ones .
O O O O O O
Similar experiments were conducted in BALB / c mice treated with PJ34 or vehicle .
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Treatment with a PJ34 significantly improved cardiac dysfunction and increased the survival of the animals .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition PJ34 significantly reduced the DOX - induced increase in the serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities but not metalloproteinase activation in the heart .
O O B O O O B O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , PARP activation contributes to the cardiotoxicity of DOX .
O O O O O O O O O B O
PARP inhibitors may exert protective effects against the development of severe cardiac complications associated with the DOX treatment .

Fluconazole - induced torsade de pointes .
B O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE :
O O
To present a case of fluconazole - associated torsade de pointes ( TDP ) and discuss fluconazole 's role in causing TDP .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
CASE SUMMARY :
O O O
A 68 - year - old white woman with Candida glabrata isolated from a presacral abscess developed TDP eight days after commencing oral fluconazole
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B
The patient had no other risk factors for TDP , including coronary artery disease , cardiomyopathy , congestive heart failure , and electrolyte abnormalities There was a temporal association between
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the initiation of fluconazole and TDP .
O O O B O O O
The TDP resolved when fluconazole was discontinued ; however , the patient continued to have premature ventricular contractions and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia ( NSVT ) until six days after drug
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cessation DISCUSSION
O O
: Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the use of fluconazole and the development of TDP .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The possible mechanism is depression of rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium currents .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O
In our patient , there was no other etiology identified that could explain QT prolongation or TDP
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The complete disappearance of NSVT and premature ventricular contractions followed by normalization of QT interval after the drug was stopped strongly suggests fluconazole as the etiology .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
CONCLUSIONS :
O O
Clinicians should be aware that fluconazole , even at low doses , may cause prolongation of the QT interval , leading to TDP .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Serial electrocardiographic monitoring may be considered when fluconazole is administered in patients who are at risk for ventricular arrhythmias .

High - dose methylprednisolone may do more harm for spinal cord injury .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Because of the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Studies ( NASCIS ) , high - dose methylprednisolone became the standard of care for the acute spinal cord injury .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the NASCIS , there was no mention regarding the possibility of acute corticosteroid myopathy that high - dose methylprednisolone may cause .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O
The dosage of methylprednisolone recommended by the NASCIS 3 is the highest dose of steroids ever being used during a 2 - day period for any clinical condition .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We hypothesize that it may cause some damage to the muscle of spinal cord injury patients .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Further , steroid myopathy recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the steroid myopathy , instead
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
of any protection that methylprednisolone offers to the spinal cord injury .
O O O O B O O O O O O O
To our knowledge , this is the first discussion considering the possibility that the methylprednisolone recommended by NASCIS may cause acute corticosteroid myopathy .

Pupil diameter was monitored using a computerized infrared pupillometer over 4 hours .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The study involved 4 sessions .
O O O O O O
In 1 session , tropicamide ( 20 microL , 0 . 01 % ) was administered to one eye and placebo to the other .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In another session , tropicamide ( 20 microL , 0 . 01 % ) was administered to both eyes , followed 23 minutes later by the application of pilocarpine (

20 microL , 0 . 1 % ) to one eye and placebo to the other .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All eye drops were given in a randomized order .
O O O O O O O O O O
In 2 separate sessions , a single dose of scopolamine ( 0 . 5 mg , intravenously ) or placebo was administered , and the effects on word recall were

Pupil size at time points after administration of tropicamide and pilocarpine ; scopolamine - induced impairment in word recall .
O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
There was no significant difference between elderly and young volunteers in pupillary response to tropicamide at any time point ( p > 0 . 05 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
The elderly group had a significantly greater pilocarpine - induced net decrease in pupil size 85 , 125 , 165 and 215 minutes after administration , compared with the young
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
group ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
O O O O O O O O O
Compared with the young group , the elderly group had greater scopolamine - induced impairment in word recall 60 , 90 and 120 minutes after administration ( p < 0
O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
There is an age - related pupillary response to pilocarpine that is not found with tropicamide .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O
Thus , pilocarpine may be useful to assess variations in central cholinergic function in elderly patients .

Neutrophils from 14 ALF patients were stimulated via the complement receptors using zymosan opsonized with ALF or control serum .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by ALF neutrophils stimulated with zymosan opsonized with ALF serum was significantly reduced compared with the control subjects ( P < 0 . 01 )

This defect persisted when zymosan opsonized by control serum was used ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production in neutrophils stimulated with formyl - methionyl - leucyl - phenylalanine ( fMLP ) from a further 18 ALF patients was unaffected compared with control

neutrophils .
O O
Serum C3 complement levels were significantly reduced in ALF patients compared with control subjects ( P < 0 . 0005 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results demonstrate a neutrophil defect in ALF due to paracetamol overdose , that is complement dependent but independent of serum complement , possibly connected to the complement receptor .

Absence of effect of sertraline on time - based sensitization of cognitive impairment with haloperidol .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O
This double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled study evaluated the effects of haloperidol alone and haloperidol plus sertraline on cognitive and psychomotor function in 24 healthy male
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O B O O O O O O O O O
subjects .
O O
METHOD :
O O
All subjects received placebo on Day 1 and haloperidol 2 mg on Days 2 and 25 .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
From Days 9 to 25 , subjects were randomly assigned to either sertraline ( 12 subjects ) or placebo ( 12 subjects ) ; the sertraline dose was titrated from
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
50 to 200 mg / day from Days 9 to 16 , and remained at 200 mg / day for the final 10 days of the drug administration period .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cognitive function testing was performed before dosing and over a 24 - hour period after dosing on Days 1 , 2 , and 25 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS :
O O
Impairment of cognitive function was observed 6 to 8 hours after administration of haloperidol on Day 2 but was not evident 23 hours after dosing .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
When single - dose haloperidol was given again 25 days later , greater impairment with earlier onset was noted in several tests in both treatment groups , suggesting enhancement of
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this effect .
O O O
There was no indication that sertraline exacerbated the impairment produced by haloperidol since an equivalent effect also occurred in the placebo group .
O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Three subjects ( 2 on sertraline and 1 on placebo ) withdrew from the study because of side effects .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ten subjects in each group reported side effects related to treatment .
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The side effect profiles of sertraline and of placebo were similar .
O O O O O B O O O O O O
CONCLUSION :
O O
Haloperidol produced a clear profile of cognitive impairment that was not worsened by concomitant sertraline administration .

Ciprofloxacin - induced nephrotoxicity in patients with cancer .
B O O O O O O O O
Nephrotoxicity associated with ciprofloxacin is uncommon .
O O O B O O O
Five patients with cancer who developed acute renal failure that followed treatment with ciprofloxacin are described and an additional 15 cases reported in the literature are reviewed .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Other than elevation of serum creatinine levels , characteristic clinical manifestations and abnormal laboratory findings are not frequently present .
O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Allergic interstitial nephritis is believed to be the underlying pathological - process .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Definitive diagnosis requires performance of renal biopsy , although this is not always feasible .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An improvement in renal function that followed the discontinuation of the offending antibiotic supports the presumptive diagnosis of ciprofloxacin - induced acute renal failure .

Case report : pentamidine and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia revisited .
O O O B O O O O O O
Pentamidine isethionate has been associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmias , including torsade de pointes .
B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
This article reports two cases of this complication and reviews all reported cases to date .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pentamidine - induced torsade de pointes may be related to serum magnesium levels and hypomagnesemia may synergistically induce torsade .
B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Torsade de pointes occurred after an average of 10 days of treatment with pentamidine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
In these patients , no other acute side effects of pentamidine were observed .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Torsade de pointes can be treated when recognized early , possibly without discontinuation of pentamidine .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
When QTc interval prolongation is observed , early magnesium supplementation is advocated .

Time dependence of plasma malondialdehyde , oxypurines , and nucleosides during incomplete cerebral ischemia in the rat .
O O O O B O B O O B O O O O O O O O
Incomplete cerebral ischemia ( 30 min ) was induced in the rat by bilaterally clamping the common carotid arteries .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Peripheral venous blood samples were withdrawn from the femoral vein four times ( once every 5 min ) before ischemia ( 0 time ) and 5 , 15 , and
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
30 min after ischemia .
O O O O O
Plasma extracts were analyzed by a highly sensitive high - performance liquid chromatographic method for the direct determination of malondialdehyde , oxypurines , and nucleosides .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O B O
During ischemia , a time - dependent increase of plasma oxypurines and nucleosides was observed .
O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O
Plasma malondialdehyde , which was present in minimal amount at zero time ( 0 . 058 mumol / liter plasma ; SD 0 . 015 ) , increased after 5
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
min of ischemia , resulting in a fivefold increase after 30 min of carotid occlusion ( 0 . 298 mumol / liter plasma ; SD 0 . 078 ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Increased plasma malondialdehyde was also recorded in two other groups of animals subjected to the same experimental model , one receiving 20 mg / kg b . w .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor acetylsalicylate intravenously immediately before ischemia , the other receiving 650 micrograms / kg b . w .

of the hypotensive drug nitroprusside at a flow rate of 103 microliters / min intravenously during ischemia ,
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although in this latter group malondialdehyde was significantly higher .
O O O O O B O O O O
The present data indicate that the determination of malondialdehyde , oxypurines , and nucleosides in peripheral blood , may be used to monitor the metabolic alterations of tissues occurring during

Acute renal failure in high dose carboplatin chemotherapy .
O O O O O O B O O
Carboplatin has been reported to cause acute renal failure when administered in high doses to adult patients .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We report a 4 1 / 2 - year - old girl who was treated with high - dose carboplatin for metastatic parameningeal embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Acute renal failure developed followed by a slow partial recovery of renal function .

Endometrial carcinoma after Hodgkin disease in childhood .
O O O O O O O O
A 34 - year - old patient developed metastic endometrial carcinoma after Hodgkin disease in childhood .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She had ovarian failure after abdominal irradiation and chemotherapy for Hodgkin disease , and received exogenous estrogens , a treatment implicated in the development of endometrial cancer in menopausal women
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
.
O
Young women on replacement estrogens for ovarian failure after cancer therapy may also have increased risk of endometrial carcinoma and should be examined periodically .

Induction of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in a woman by exogenous androgen administration .
O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
We documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high supraglottic resistance while awake in a 54 - yr - old woman who had developed physical changes and the syndrome
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of obstructive sleep apnea while being administered exogenous androgens .
O O O O O O O O B O
When the androgens were withdrawn , the patient 's physical changes , symptoms , sleep study , and supraglottic resistance all returned to normal .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A rechallenge with androgen produced symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea that abated upon withdrawal of the hormone .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Previous reports have favored a role of androgens in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Our report provides direct evidence for this role .
O O O O O O O O O
Structural and functional measurements indicate that androgens exert a permissive or necessary action on the structural configuration of the oropharynx that predisposes to obstruction during sleep .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Development of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome must be considered a possible side effect of androgen therapy .

Effect of captopril on pre - existing and aminonucleoside - induced proteinuria in spontaneously hypertensive rats .
O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Proteinuria is a side effect of captopril treatment in hypertensive patients .
O O O O O O B O O O O O
The possibility of reproducing the same renal abnormality with captopril was examined in SHR .
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Oral administration of captopril at 100 mg / kg for 14 days failed to aggravate proteinuria pre - existing in SHR .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also , captopril treatment failed to potentiate or facilitate development of massive proteinuria invoked by puromycin aminonucleoside in SHR .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O
Captopril had little or no demonstrable effects on serum electrolyte concentrations , excretion of urine , sodium and potassium , endogenous creatinine clearance , body weight , and food and

Epileptogenic properties of enflurane and their clinical interpretation .
O O O B O O O O O
Three cases of EEG changes induced by single exposure to enflurane anesthesia are reported .
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
In one patient , enflurane administered during a donor nephrectomy resulted in unexpected partial motor seizures .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Until the cause of the seizures was correctly identified , the patient was inappropriately treated with anticonvulsants .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two other patients suffered from partial , complex and generalized seizures uncontrolled by medication .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Epileptic foci delineated and activated by enflurane were surgically ablated and the patients are now seizure - free .
O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Previous exposures to enflurane have to be disclosed to avoid mistakes in clinical interpretation of the EEG .
O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On the other hand , enflurane may prove to be a safe fast acting activator of epileptic foci during corticography or depth electrode intraoperative recordings .

A double - blind placebo - controlled investigation of efficacy and safety .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of Ro15 - 1788 and a placebo in reversing diazepam - induced effects after surgery under epidural block , and
O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
to evaluate the local tolerance and general safety of Ro15 - 1788 .
O O O O O O O O O B I I O
Fifty - seven patients were sedated with diazepam for surgery under epidural anaesthesia .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Antagonism of diazepam - induced effects by Ro15 - 1788 was investigated postoperatively in a double - blind placebo - controlled trial .
O O B O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient 's subjective assessment of mood rating , an objective test of performance , a test for amnesia , and vital signs were recorded for up to 300 min
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after administration of the trial drug .
O O O O O O O
No significant differences between the two groups were observed for mood rating , amnesia , or vital signs .

Enhanced stimulus - induced neurotransmitter overflow in epinephrine - induced hypertensive rats is not mediated by prejunctional beta - adrenoceptor activation .
O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The present study examines the effect of 6 - day epinephrine treatment ( 100 micrograms / kg per h , s . c . ) on stimulus - induced (
O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 Hz ) endogenous neurotransmitter overflow from the isolated perfused kidney of vehicle - and epinephrine - treated rats .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Renal catecholamine stores and stimulus - induced overflow in the vehicle - treated group consisted of norepinephrine only .
O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
However , epinephrine treatment resulted in the incorporation of epinephrine into renal catecholamine stores such that approximately 40 % of the catecholamine present was epinephrine while the norepinephrine content was
O O B O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O B O O B O O B O O
reduced by a similar degree .
O O O O O O
Total tissue catecholamine content of the kidney on a molar basis was unchanged .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Stimulus - induced fractional overflow of neurotransmitter from the epinephrine - treated kidneys was approximately twice normal and consisted of both norepinephrine and epinephrine in proportions similar to those found
O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O
in the kidney .
O O O O
This difference in fractional overflow between groups was not affected by neuronal and extraneuronal uptake blockade .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Propranolol had no effect on stimulus - induced overflow in either group .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Phentolamine increased stimulus - induced overflow in both groups although the increment in overflow was greater in the epinephrine - treated group .
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
In conclusion , chronic epinephrine treatment results in enhanced fractional neurotransmitter overflow .
O O O O B O O O O O O O O
However , neither alterations in prejunctional beta - adrenoceptor influences nor alterations in neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanisms appear to be responsible for this alteration .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , data obtained with phentolamine alone do not suggest alpha - adrenoceptor desensitization as the cause of the enhanced neurotransmitter overflow after epinephrine treatment .

Ocular manifestations of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis .
O O O O O O O
We followed 210 cases of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis closely for eleven years .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thirty - six of the 210 patients ( 17 . 2 % ) developed iridocyclitis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Iridocyclitis was seen most frequently in young female patients ( 0 to 4 years ) with the monoarticular or pauciatricular form of the arthritis .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , 30 % of the patients developed uveitis after 16 years of age .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although 61 % of patients had a noncontributory ocular history on entry , 42 % had active uveitis on entry .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our approach was effective in detecting uveitis in new cases and exacerbations of uveitis in established cases .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Forty - four percent of patients with uveitis had one or more identifiable signs or symptoms , such as red eye , ocular pain , decreased visual acuity , or
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
photophobia , in order of decreasing frequency .
O O O O O O O O
Even after early detection and prompt treatment , 41 % of cases of uveitis did not respond to more than six months of intensive topical treatment with corticosteroids and mydriatics
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
.
O
Despite this , there was a dramatic decrease in the 50 % incidence of blinding complications of uveitis cited in earlier studies .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cataract and band keratopathy occurred in only 22 and 13 % of our group , respectively .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in 173 of 210 cases and found only one case of chorioretinopathy attributable to these drugs .
O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Systemically administered corticosteroids were used in 75 of 210 cases ; a significant number of posterior subcapsular cataracts was found .
O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Typical keratoconjunctivitis sicca developed in three of the uveitis cases .
O O O O O O O O O O O
This association with uveitis and JRA was not noted previously .

Water intoxication associated with oxytocin administration during saline - induced abortion .
O O O O B O O O O O O O
Four cases of water intoxication in connection with oxytocin administration during saline - induced abortions are described .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
The mechanism of water intoxication is discussed in regard to these cases .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Oxytocin administration during midtrimester - induced abortions is advocated only if it can be carried out under careful observations of an alert nursing staff , aware of the symptoms of
B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
water intoxication and instructed to watch the diuresis and report such early signs of the syndrome as asthenia , muscular irritability , or headaches .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The oxytocin should be given only in Ringers lactate or , alternately , in Ringers lactate and a 5 per cent dextrose and water solutions .
O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O
The urinary output should be monitored and the oxytocin administration discontinued and the serum electrolytes checked if the urinary output decreases .
O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The oxytocin should not be administered in excess of 36 hours .
O B O O O O O O O O O O
If the patient has not aborted by then the oxytocin should be discontinued for 10 to 12 hours in order to perform electrolyte determinations and correct any electrolyte imbalance .
