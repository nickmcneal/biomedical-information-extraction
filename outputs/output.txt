Sentence: source of pain and primitive dysfunction in migraine : an identical site ?
Drugs: 
Sentence: twenty common migraine patients received a one sided frontotemporal application of nitroglycerin ( 10 patients ) or placebo ointment ( 10 patients ) in a double blind study .
Drugs: nitroglycerin
Sentence: early onset migraine attacks were induced by nitroglycerin in seven out of 10 patients versus no patient in the placebo group .
Drugs: nitroglycerin
Sentence: subsequently 20 migraine patients , who developed an early onset attack with frontotemporal nitroglycerin , received the drug in a second induction test at other body areas .
Drugs: nitroglycerin
Sentence: no early onset migraine was observed .
Drugs: 
Sentence: thus the migraine - inducing effect of nitroglycerin seems to depend on direct stimulation of the habitual site of pain , suggesting that the frontotemporal region is of crucial importance

Sentence: the amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and amca alone .
Drugs: amca
Sentence: it is suggested that the effects of captopril on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of angiotension ii and
Drugs: captoprilii, ii
Sentence: an increase in prostacyclin ( secondary to an increase in bradykinin ) .
Drugs: prostacyclin, bradykinin
Sentence: captopril may , by the same mechanism , reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin , thereby diminishing the aggregation of

Sentence: the follow - up period was 12 months .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the timolol - treated patients showed a small but significant increase in heart size from baseline in contrast to a decrease in the placebo group .
Drugs: timolol
Sentence: these differences may be caused by timolol - induced bradycardia and a compensatory increase in end - diastolic volume .
Drugs: timolol
Sentence: the timolol - related increase in heart size was observed only in patients with normal and borderline heart size .
Drugs: timolol
Sentence: in patients with cardiomegaly , the increase in heart size was similar in both groups .

Drugs: vitamind, d, warfarin
Sentence: gla protein , a calcification inhibitor known to be expressed by smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the artery wall .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery calcification in warfarin - treated rats .
Drugs: warfarin
Sentence: treatment for 2 weeks with warfarin caused massive focal calcification of the artery media in 20 - day - old rats and less extensive focal calcification in 42 - day
Drugs: warfarin
Sentence: - old rats .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in contrast , no artery calcification could be detected in 10 - month - old adult rats even after 4 weeks of warfarin treatment .
Drugs: warfarin
Sentence: to directly examine the importance of growth to warfarin - induced artery calcification in animals of the same age , 20 - day - old rats were fed for 2
Drugs: warfarin
Sentence: weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6 - g / d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth .
Drugs: 
Sentence: concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with warfarin produced massive focal calcification of the artery media in the ad libitum - fed rats but no detectable artery calcification in the
Drugs: warfarin
Sentence: restricted - diet , growth - inhibited group .
Drugs: 
Sentence: although the explanation for the association between artery calcification and growth status can not be determined from the present study , there was a relationship between higher serum phosphate and
Drugs: phosphate
Sentence: susceptibility to artery calcification , with 30 % higher levels of serum phosphate in young , ad libitum - fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant
Drugs: phosphate
Sentence: to warfarin - induced artery calcification , ie , the 10 - month - old rats and the restricted - diet , growth - inhibited young rats .
Drugs: warfarin
Sentence: this observation suggests that increased susceptibility to warfarin - induced artery calcification could be related to higher serum phosphate levels .

Sentence: high doses of the vitamin k antagonist warfarin are also known to cause calcification of the artery media , but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not
Drugs: vitamink, k, warfarin
Sentence: at 1 week .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in the current study , we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent warfarin administration dramatically increased the extent of calcification in the media of
Drugs: warfarin
Sentence: vitamin d - treated rats at 3 and 4 days .
Drugs: vitamind, d
Sentence: there was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin d dose on artery calcification and the effect of vitamin d dose on the elevation of serum calcium , which
Drugs: vitamindd, d, calcium
Sentence: suggests that vitamin d may induce artery calcification through its effect on serum calcium .
Drugs: vitamind, d, calcium
Sentence: because warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin d , the synergy between warfarin and vitamin d is probably best explained by the
Drugs: warfarindd, d
Sentence: hypothesis that warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix gla protein as a calcification inhibitor .
Drugs: warfarin
Sentence: high levels of matrix gla protein are found at sites of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin d plus warfarin , and chemical analysis showed that the protein that
Drugs: vitamind, d, warfarin
Sentence: accumulated was indeed not gamma - carboxylated .
Drugs: gamma-carboxylated, carboxylated
Sentence: these observations indicate that although the gamma - carboxyglutamate residues of matrix gla protein are apparently required for its function as a calcification inhibitor , they are not required for
Drugs: gamma-carboxyglutamate, carboxyglutamate
Sentence: its accumulation at calcification sites .

Drugs: ssris
Sentence: .
Drugs: 
Sentence: sex , age , diagnosis ( bipolar i vs . bipolar ii ) , and additional treatment did not affect the risk of switching .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the incidence of mood switches seemed not to differ between patients receiving an anticonvulsant and those receiving no mood stabilizer .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in contrast , mood switches were less frequent in patients receiving lithium ( 15 % , 4 / 26 ) than in patients not treated with lithium ( 44 %
Drugs: lithium, lithium
Sentence: , 8 / 18 ; p = . 04 ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the number of previous manic episodes did not affect the probability of switching , whereas a high score on the hyperthymia component of the semistructured affective temperament interview was associated

Drugs: 
Sentence: conclusion :
Drugs: 
Sentence: the frequency of mood switching associated with acute antidepressant therapy may be reduced by lithium treatment .
Drugs: antidepressant, lithium
Sentence: particular attention should be paid to patients with a hyperthymic temperament , who have a greater risk of mood switches .

Sentence: a significant up - regulation of alphaenac and betaenac mrna abundance on days 1 and 2 preceded sodium retention on days 2 and 3 .
Drugs: sodium
Sentence: conversely , down - regulation of alphaenac , betaenac and gammaenac mrna expression on day 3 occurred in the presence of high aldosterone concentrations , and was followed by a
Drugs: aldosterone
Sentence: return of sodium excretion to control values .
Drugs: sodium
Sentence: the amounts of alphaenac , betaenac and gammaenac proteins were not increased during pan - induced sodium retention .
Drugs: pan, sodium
Sentence: in conclusion , enac mrna expression , especially alphaenac , is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of pan - induced nephrotic syndrome in rats ,

Sentence: plasma cgrp concentration increased significantly ( p < 0 . 01 ) during the migraine attack and returned to baseline after the cessation of the migraine .
Drugs: cgrp
Sentence: in addition , both change and peak , showed significant positive correlations with migraine headache intensity ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: however , plasma cgrp concentrations failed to change during immediate headache and in the subjects with no migraine attack .
Drugs: cgrp
Sentence: basal cgrp concentration was significantly higher and platelet 5 - ht content tended to be lower in subjects who experienced a migraine attack .
Drugs: cgrp-ht, ht
Sentence: platelet serotonin content decreased significantly ( p < 0 . 01 ) after nitroglycerin in subjects with no migraine attack but no consistent change was observed in patients with migraine
Drugs: serotonin, nitroglycerin
Sentence: attack .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in conclusion , the fact that plasma cgrp concentration correlates with the timing and severity of a migraine headache suggests a direct relationship between cgrp and migraine .
Drugs: cgrp, cgrp
Sentence: in contrast , serotonin release from platelets does not provoke migraine , it may even counteract the headache and the concomitant cgrp release in this model .

Drugs: 
Sentence: pharmacological modulation of pain - related brain activity during normal and central sensitization states in humans .
Drugs: 
Sentence: abnormal processing of somatosensory inputs in the central nervous system ( central sensitization ) is the mechanism accounting for the enhanced pain sensitivity in the skin surrounding tissue injury (
Drugs: 
Sentence: secondary hyperalgesia ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: secondary hyperalgesia shares clinical characteristics with neurogenic hyperalgesia in patients with neuropathic pain .
Drugs: 
Sentence: abnormal brain responses to somatosensory stimuli have been found in patients with hyperalgesia as well as in normal subjects during experimental central sensitization .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the aim of this study was to assess the effects of gabapentin , a drug effective in neuropathic pain patients , on brain processing of nociceptive information in normal and

Sentence: skin and capsaicin - induced secondary hyperalgesia .
Drugs: capsaicin
Sentence: the dose of gabapentin was 1 , 800 mg per os , in a single administration .
Drugs: gabapentin
Sentence: we found that ( i ) gabapentin reduced the activations in the bilateral operculoinsular cortex , independently of the presence of central sensitization ; ( ii ) gabapentin reduced the
Drugs: gabapentin, gabapentin
Sentence: activation in the brainstem , only during central sensitization ; ( iii ) gabapentin suppressed stimulus - induced deactivations , only during central sensitization ; this effect was more robust
Drugs: gabapentin
Sentence: than the effect on brain activation .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the observed drug - induced effects were not due to changes in the baseline fmri signal .
Drugs: 
Sentence: these findings indicate that gabapentin has a measurable antinociceptive effect and a stronger antihyperalgesic effect most evident in the brain areas undergoing deactivation , thus supporting the concept that
Drugs: gabapentin
Sentence: gabapentin is more effective in modulating nociceptive transmission when central sensitization is present .

Sentence: in rate - pressure product .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in other individuals with no underlying atherosclerotic obstruction , coronary occlusion may be due to spasm , thrombus , or both .
Drugs: 
Sentence: with regard to spasm , the clinical findings are largely circumstantial , and the locus of cocaine - induced vasoconstriction remains speculative .
Drugs: cocaine
Sentence: although certain clinical and experimental findings support the hypothesis that spasm involves the epicardial , medium - size vessels , other data suggest intramural vasoconstriction .
Drugs: 
Sentence: diffuse intramural vasoconstriction is not consistent with reports of segmental , discrete infarction .
Drugs: 
Sentence: whereas certain in vivo data suggest that these effects are alpha - mediated , other in vitro data suggest the opposite .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the finding of cocaine - induced vasoconstriction in segments of ( noninnervated ) human umbilical artery suggests that the presence or absence of intact innervation is not sufficient to explain
Drugs: cocaine
Sentence: the discrepant data involving the possibility of alpha - mediated effects .

Sentence: there was no evidence of repair to the damaged medullary interstitial matrix , or proliferation of remaining undamaged type 1 medullary interstitial cells after the recovery period following analgesic treatment
Drugs: 
Sentence: .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the recovery of urinary concentrating ability was related to the length of analgesic treatment and the extent of the resulting inner medullary structural damage .
Drugs: 
Sentence: during the early stages of analgesic treatment , the changes in urinary concentrating ability were reversible , but after prolonged analgesic treatment , maximum urinary concentrating ability failed to recover
Drugs: 
Sentence: .
Drugs: 
Sentence: this study shows that prolonged analgesic treatment in fischer 344 rats causes progressive and irreversible damage to the interstitial matrix and type 1 interstitial cells leading to rpn .

Sentence: the surgery and anaesthesia were uneventful , but 3 days after surgery , the patient reported an area of hypoaesthesia over l3 - l4 dermatomes of the leg which had
Drugs: 
Sentence: been operated on ( loss of pinprick sensation ) without reduction in muscular strength .
Drugs: 
Sentence: sensation in this area returned to normal over the following 2 weeks .
Drugs: 
Sentence: prospective multicentre studies with a large population and a long follow - up should be performed in order to evaluate the incidence of this unusual side effect .
Drugs: 
Sentence: however , we suggest that a low solution concentration should be preferred for unilateral spinal anaesthesia with a hyperbaric anaesthetic solution ( if pencil - point needle and slow injection
Drugs:

Drugs: 
Sentence: tam induces hemolysis of erythrocytes as a function of concentration .
Drugs: tam
Sentence: the extension of hemolysis is variable with erythrocyte samples , but 12 . 5 microm tam induces total hemolysis of all tested suspensions .
Drugs: tam
Sentence: despite inducing extensive erythrocyte lysis , tam does not shift the osmotic fragility curves of erythrocytes .
Drugs: tam
Sentence: the hemolytic effect of tam is prevented by low concentrations of alpha - tocopherol ( alpha - t ) and alpha - tocopherol acetate ( alpha - tac ) (
Drugs: tam-tocopherol-t-tocopherolacetate-tac, tac
Sentence: inactivated functional hydroxyl ) indicating that tam - induced hemolysis is not related to oxidative membrane damage .
Drugs: hydroxyl, tam
Sentence: this was further evidenced by absence of oxygen consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with tam - induced hemolysis .
Drugs: oxygen, tam
Sentence: furthermore , it was observed that tam inhibits the peroxidation of human erythrocytes induced by aaph , thus ruling out tam - induced cell oxidative stress .
Drugs: tam, aaph, tam
Sentence: hemolysis caused by tam was not preceded by the leakage of k ( + ) from the cells , also excluding a colloid - osmotic type mechanism of hemolysis ,
Drugs: tam, k
Sentence: according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves .
Drugs: 
Sentence: however , tam induces release of peripheral proteins of membrane - cytoskeleton and cytosol proteins essentially bound to band 3 .
Drugs: tam
Sentence: either alpha - t or alpha - tac increases membrane packing and prevents tam partition into model membranes .
Drugs: alpha-t-tac, tac, tam
Sentence: these effects suggest that the protection from hemolysis by tocopherols is related to a decreased tam incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently
Drugs: tocopherols, tam

Sentence: therefore , tam - induced hemolysis results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane , leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused
Drugs: tam
Sentence: by its high partition in the membrane .
Drugs: 
Sentence: these defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by tam , resulting in hemolytic anemia .
Drugs: tam
Sentence: additionally , since membrane leakage is a final stage of cytotoxicity , the disruption of the structural characteristics of biomembranes by tam may contribute to the multiple mechanisms of its

Drugs: 
Sentence: when activating the ( na , k ) - atpase with its substrate atp , no changes in km and vmax values were observed in no - deficient rats .
Drugs: na, k, atp, no
Sentence: during activation with na + , the vmax remained unchanged , however the k ( na ) increased by 50 % , indicating a profound decrease in the affinity of
Drugs: na, k, na
Sentence: the na + - binding site in no - deficient rats .
Drugs: na, no
Sentence: after recovery from hypertension , the activity of ( na , k ) - atpase increased , due to higher affinity of the atp - binding site , as revealed
Drugs: na, k, atp
Sentence: from the lowered km value for atp .
Drugs: atp
Sentence: the k ( na ) value for na + returned to control value .
Drugs: k, na, na
Sentence: inhibition of no - synthase induced a reversible hypertension accompanied by depressed na + - extrusion from cardiac cells as a consequence of deteriorated na + - binding properties of
Drugs: no, na, na
Sentence: the ( na , k ) - atpase .
Drugs: na, k
Sentence: after recovery of blood pressure to control values , the extrusion of na + from cardiac cells was normalized , as revealed by restoration of the ( na ,

Sentence: effects of long - term pretreatment with isoproterenol on bromocriptine - induced tachycardia in conscious rats .
Drugs: isoproterenol, bromocriptine
Sentence: it has been shown that bromocriptine - induced tachycardia , which persisted after adrenalectomy , is ( i ) mediated by central dopamine d2 receptor activation and ( ii )
Drugs: bromocriptine, dopamine
Sentence: reduced by 5 - day isoproterenol pretreatment , supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart .
Drugs: isoproterenol
Sentence: this study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with isoproterenol could abolish bromocriptine - induced tachycardia in conscious rats .
Drugs: isoproterenol, bromocriptine
Sentence: isoproterenol pretreatment for 15 days caused cardiac hypertrophy without affecting baseline blood pressure and heart rate .
Drugs: isoproterenol
Sentence: in control rats , intravenous bromocriptine ( 150 microg / kg ) induced significant hypotension and tachycardia .
Drugs: bromocriptine
Sentence: bromocriptine - induced hypotension was unaffected by isoproterenol pretreatment , while tachycardia was reversed to significant bradycardia , an effect that was partly reduced by i . v .
Drugs: bromocriptine, isoproterenol
Sentence: domperidone ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) .
Drugs: domperidone
Sentence: neither cardiac vagal nor sympathetic tone was altered by isoproterenol pretreatment .

Drugs: isoproterenol, isoproterenol
Sentence: pretreated rats ( the ec50 of the isoproterenol - induced increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was enhanced approximately 22 - fold ) .
Drugs: isoproterenol
Sentence: these results show that 15 - day isoproterenol pretreatment not only abolished but reversed bromocriptine - induced tachycardia to bradycardia , an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac
Drugs: isoproterenol, bromocriptine
Sentence: beta - adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart .
Drugs: 
Sentence: they suggest that , in normal conscious rats , the central tachycardia of bromocriptine appears to predominate and to mask the bradycardia of this agonist at peripheral dopamine d2 receptors

Sentence: a developmental analysis of clonidine 's effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production in infant rats .
Drugs: clonidine
Sentence: under controlled conditions , infant rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations during extreme cold exposure and after administration of the alpha ( 2 ) adrenoceptor agonist , clonidine .
Drugs: clonidine
Sentence: previous investigations have determined that , in response to clonidine , ultrasound production increases through the 2nd - week postpartum and decreases thereafter .
Drugs: clonidine
Sentence: given that sympathetic neural dominance exhibits a similar developmental pattern , and given that clonidine induces sympathetic withdrawal and bradycardia , we hypothesized that clonidine 's developmental effects on cardiac
Drugs: clonidine, clonidine
Sentence: rate and ultrasound production would mirror each other .
Drugs: 
Sentence: therefore , in the present experiment , the effects of clonidine administration ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) on cardiac rate and ultrasound production were examined in 2
Drugs: clonidine
Sentence: - , 8 - , 15 - , and 20 - day - old rats .
Drugs: 
Sentence: age - related changes in ultrasound production corresponded with changes in cardiovascular variables , including baseline cardiac rate and clonidine - induced bradycardia .
Drugs: clonidine
Sentence: this experiment is discussed with regard to the hypothesis that ultrasound production is the acoustic by - product of a physiological maneuver that compensates for clonidine 's detrimental effects on

Drugs: 
Sentence: .
Drugs: 
Sentence: ketamine reduced both the area of brush - evoked and punctate - evoked hyperalgesia significantly and it tended to reduce brush - evoked pain .
Drugs: ketamine
Sentence: lidocaine reduced the area of punctate - evoked hyperalgesia significantly .
Drugs: lidocaine
Sentence: it tended to reduce vas scores of spontaneous pain but had no effect on evoked pain .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the differential effects of ketamine and lidocaine on static and dynamic hyperalgesia suggest that the two types of hyperalgesia are mediated by separate mechanisms and have a distinct pharmacology .
Drugs: ketamine, lidocaine
Sentence: cyclosporine and tacrolimus - associated thrombotic microangiopathy .
Drugs: cyclosporine, tacrolimus
Sentence: the development of thrombotic microangiopathy ( tma ) associated with the use of cyclosporine has been well documented .

Sentence: treatments have included discontinuation or reduction of cyclosporine dose with or without concurrent plasma exchange , plasma infusion , anticoagulation , and intravenous immunoglobulin g infusion .
Drugs: cyclosporine
Sentence: however , for recipients of organ transplantation , removing the inciting agent is not without the attendant risk of precipitating acute rejection and graft loss .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the last decade has seen the emergence of tacrolimus as a potent immunosuppressive agent with mechanisms of action virtually identical to those of cyclosporine .
Drugs: tacrolimus, cyclosporine
Sentence: as a result , switching to tacrolimus has been reported to be a viable therapeutic option in the setting of cyclosporine - induced tma .
Drugs: tacrolimus, cyclosporine
Sentence: with the more widespread application of tacrolimus in organ transplantation , tacrolimus - associated tma has also been recognized .
Drugs: tacrolimus, tacrolimus
Sentence: however , literature regarding the incidence of the recurrence of tma in patients exposed sequentially to cyclosporine and tacrolimus is limited .

Sentence: we report a case of a living donor renal transplant recipient who developed cyclosporine - induced tma that responded to the withdrawal of cyclosporine in conjunction with plasmapheresis and fresh
Drugs: cyclosporine, cyclosporine
Sentence: frozen plasma replacement therapy .
Drugs: 
Sentence: introduction of tacrolimus as an alternative immunosuppressive agent resulted in the recurrence of tma and the subsequent loss of the renal allograft .
Drugs: tacrolimus
Sentence: patients who are switched from cyclosporine to tacrolimus or vice versa should be closely monitored for the signs and symptoms of recurrent tma .
Drugs: cyclosporine, tacrolimus

Sentence: losartan administration .
Drugs: losartan
Sentence: he was hospitalized for a myocardial infarction with pulmonary edema , treated with high - dose diuretics .
Drugs: 
Sentence: due to severe systolic dysfunction losartan was prescribed .
Drugs: losartan
Sentence: surprisingly , the first dose of 50 mg of losartan resulted in a sudden anuria , which lasted eight hours despite high - dose furosemide and amine infusion .
Drugs: losartan, furosemide, amine
Sentence: one week later , by mistake , losartan was prescribed again and after the second dose of 50 mg , the patient developed a second episode of transient anuria lasting
Drugs: losartan
Sentence: 10 hours .
Drugs: 
Sentence: during these two episodes , his blood pressure diminished but no severe hypotension was noted .
Drugs: 
Sentence: ultimately , an arteriography showed a 70 - 80 % renal artery stenosis .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in this patient , renal artery stenosis combined with heart failure and diuretic therapy certainly resulted in a strong activation of the renin - angiotensin system ( ras ) .
Drugs: angiotensin
Sentence: under such conditions , angiotensin ii receptor blockade by losartan probably induced a critical fall in glomerular filtration pressure .
Drugs: angiotensinii, ii, losartan
Sentence: this case report highlights the fact that the angiotensin ii receptor antagonist losartan can cause serious unexpected complications in patients with renovascular disease and should be used with extreme caution

Drugs: 
Sentence: in addition to microscopic evaluation of damage and / or protection in corresponding pas stained tissues .
Drugs: 
Sentence: results indicate that gspe preexposure prior to aap , ami and dox , provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes ( alt , bun and cpk )
Drugs: gspe, aap, ami, dox
Sentence: , and significantly reduced dna fragmentation .
Drugs: 
Sentence: histopathological examination of kidney , heart and lung sections revealed moderate to massive tissue damage with a variety of morphological aberrations by all the three drugs in the absence of
Drugs: 
Sentence: gspe preexposure than in its presence .
Drugs: gspe
Sentence: gspe + drug exposed tissues exhibited minor residual damage or near total recovery .
Drugs: gspe
Sentence: additionally , histopathological alterations mirrored both serum chemistry changes and the pattern of dna fragmentation .
Drugs: 
Sentence: interestingly , all the drugs , such as , aap , ami and dox induced apoptotic death in addition to necrosis in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked
Drugs: aap, ami, dox
Sentence: by gspe .
Drugs: gspe
Sentence: since aap , ami and dox undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo , the protection by gspe may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism
Drugs: aap, ami, dox, gspe
Sentence: and / or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in addition , its ' presumed contribution to dna repair may be another important attribute , which played a role in the chemoprevention process .
Drugs: 
Sentence: additionally , this may have been the first report on ami - induced apoptotic death in the lung tissue .
Drugs: ami
Sentence: taken together , these events undoubtedly establish gspe 's abundant bioavailability , and the power to defend multiple target organs from toxic assaults induced by structurally diverse and functionally different

Drugs: 
Sentence: in independent groups , morphine inhibited the intestinal transit in 48 + / - 4 % and 38 + / - 4 % after acute and chronic treatment , respectively
Drugs: morphine
Sentence: , suggesting that tolerance did not develop to the constipating effects .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the combination inhibited intestinal transit similar to that produced by morphine regardless of the time of treatment , suggesting that metamizol did not potentiate morphine - induced constipation .
Drugs: morphine, metamizol, morphine
Sentence: these findings show a significant interaction between morphine and metamizol in chronically treated rats , suggesting that this combination could be useful for the treatment of chronic pain .
Drugs: morphine, metamizol

Sentence: noxious chemical stimulation of rat facial mucosa increases intracranial blood flow through a trigemino - parasympathetic reflex - - an experimental model for vascular dysfunctions in cluster headache .
Drugs: 
Sentence: cluster headache is characterized by typical autonomic dysfunctions including facial and intracranial vascular disturbances .
Drugs: 
Sentence: both the trigeminal and the cranial parasympathetic systems may be involved in mediating these dysfunctions .
Drugs: 
Sentence: an experimental model was developed in the rat to measure changes in lacrimation and intracranial blood flow following noxious chemical stimulation of facial mucosa .
Drugs: 
Sentence: blood flow was monitored in arteries of the exposed cranial dura mater and the parietal cortex using laser doppler flowmetry .
Drugs: 
Sentence: capsaicin ( 0 . 01 - 1 mm ) applied to oral or nasal mucosa induced increases in dural and cortical blood flow and provoked lacrimation .
Drugs: capsaicin
Sentence: these responses were blocked by systemic pre - administration of hexamethonium chloride ( 20 mg / kg ) .

Drugs: atropine
Sentence: , 4 , tyr6 ] - vip ( 0 . 1 mm ) , a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( vip ) antagonist , onto the exposed dura mater .
Drugs: 
Sentence: we conclude that noxious stimulation of facial mucosa increases intracranial blood flow and lacrimation via a trigemino - parasympathetic reflex .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the blood flow responses seem to be mediated by the release of acetylcholine and vip within the meninges .
Drugs: acetylcholine
Sentence: similar mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of cluster headache .
Drugs: 
Sentence: recurrent excitation in the dentate gyrus of a murine model of temporal lobe epilepsy .
Drugs: 
Sentence: similar to rats , systemic pilocarpine injection causes status epilepticus ( se ) and the eventual development of spontaneous seizures and mossy fiber sprouting in c57bl / 6 and cd1
Drugs: pilocarpine
Sentence: mice , but the physiological correlates of these events have not been identified in mice .
Drugs: 
Sentence: population responses in granule cells of the dentate gyrus were examined in transverse slices of the ventral hippocampus from pilocarpine - treated and untreated mice .
Drugs: pilocarpine
Sentence: in mg ( 2 + ) - free bathing medium containing bicuculline , conditions designed to increase excitability in the slices , electrical stimulation of the hilus resulted in a
Drugs: mg, bicuculline
Sentence: single population spike in granule cells from control mice and pilocarpine - treated mice that did not experience se .
Drugs: pilocarpine
Sentence: in se survivors , similar stimulation resulted in a population spike followed , at a variable latency , by negative dc shifts and repetitive afterdischarges of 3 - 60 s
Drugs: 
Sentence: duration , which were blocked by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists .
Drugs: glutamate
Sentence: focal glutamate photostimulation of the granule cell layer at sites distant from the recording pipette resulted in population responses of 1 - 30 s duration in slices from se survivors
Drugs: glutamate

Sentence: explicit episodic memory for sensory - discriminative components of capsaicin - induced pain : immediate and delayed ratings .
Drugs: capsaicin
Sentence: pain memory is thought to affect future pain sensitivity and thus contribute to clinical pain conditions .
Drugs: 
Sentence: systematic investigations of the human capacity to remember sensory features of experimental pain are sparse .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in order to address long - term pain memory , nine healthy male volunteers received intradermal injections of three doses of capsaicin ( 0 . 05 , 1 and 20
Drugs: capsaicin
Sentence: microg , separated by 15 min breaks ) , each given three times in a balanced design across three sessions at one week intervals .
Drugs: 
Sentence: pain rating was performed using a computerized visual analogue scale ( 0 - 100 ) digitized at 1 / s , either immediately online or one hour or one day
Drugs: 
Sentence: after injection .
Drugs: 
Sentence: subjects also recalled their pains one week later .
Drugs: 
Sentence: capsaicin injection reliably induced a dose - dependent flare ( p < 0 . 001 ) without any difference within or across sessions .
Drugs: capsaicin
Sentence: the strong burning pain decayed exponentially within a few minutes .
Drugs: 
Sentence: subjects were able to reliably discriminate pain magnitude and duration across capsaicin doses ( both p < 0 . 001 ) , regardless of whether first - time ratings were
Drugs: capsaicin
Sentence: requested immediately , after one hour or after one day .
Drugs: 
Sentence: pain recall after one week was similarly precise ( magnitude : p < 0 . 01 , duration : p < 0 . 05 ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: correlation with rating recall after one week was best when first - time ratings were requested as late as one day after injection ( r ( 2 ) = 0
Drugs: 
Sentence: . 79 ) indicating that both rating retrievals utilized similar memory traces .
Drugs: 
Sentence: these results indicate a reliable memory for magnitude and duration of experimentally induced pain .

Drugs: 
Sentence: capsaicin - induced muscle pain alters the excitability of the human jaw - stretch reflex .
Drugs: capsaicin
Sentence: the pathophysiology of painful temporomandibular disorders is not fully understood , but evidence suggests that muscle pain modulates motor function in characteristic ways .
Drugs: 
Sentence: this study tested the hypothesis that activation of nociceptive muscle afferent fibers would be linked to an increased excitability of the human jaw - stretch reflex and whether this process
Drugs: 
Sentence: would be sensitive to length and velocity of the stretch .
Drugs: 
Sentence: capsaicin ( 10 micro g ) was injected into the masseter muscle to induce pain in 11 healthy volunteers .
Drugs: capsaicin
Sentence: short - latency reflex responses were evoked in the masseter and temporalis muscles by a stretch device with different velocities and displacements before , during , and after the pain
Drugs: 
Sentence: .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the normalized reflex amplitude increased with an increase in velocity at a given displacement , but remained constant with different displacements at a given velocity .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the normalized reflex amplitude was significantly higher during pain , but only at faster stretches in the painful muscle .
Drugs: 
Sentence: increased sensitivity of the fusimotor system during acute muscle pain could be one likely mechanism to explain the findings .
Drugs: 
Sentence: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for levodopa - induced dyskinesias in parkinson 's disease .

Sentence: ten patients with pd and prominent dyskinesias had rtms ( 1 , 800 pulses ; 1 hz rate ) delivered over the motor cortex for 4 consecutive days twice ,
Drugs: 
Sentence: once real stimuli and once sham stimulation were used ; evaluations were done at the baseline and 1 day after the end of each of the treatment series .
Drugs: 
Sentence: direct comparison between sham and real rtms effects showed no significant difference in clinician - assessed dyskinesia severity .
Drugs: 
Sentence: however , comparison with the baseline showed small but significant reduction in dyskinesia severity following real rtms but not placebo .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the major effect was on dystonia subscore .
Drugs: 
Sentence: similarly , in patient diaries , although both treatments caused reduction in subjective dyskinesia scores during the days of intervention , the effect was sustained for 3 days after the
Drugs: 
Sentence: intervention for the real rtms only .
Drugs: 
Sentence: following rtms , no side effects and no adverse effects on motor function and pd symptoms were noted .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the results suggest the existence of residual beneficial clinical aftereffects of consecutive daily applications of low - frequency rtms on dyskinesias in pd .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the effects may be further exploited for potential therapeutic uses .

Sentence: background :
Drugs: 
Sentence: fibrin sealants ( fs ) derived from human plasma are frequently used in neurosurgery .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in order to increase clot stability , fs typically contain aprotinin , a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor .
Drugs: 
Sentence: recently , synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid ( tamca ) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin .
Drugs: tranexamicacid, acid, tamca
Sentence: however , tamca has been shown to cause epileptic seizures .
Drugs: tamca
Sentence: we wanted to study whether tamca retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a fs .
Drugs: tamca

Drugs: 
Sentence: fs containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tamca ( 0 . 5 - 47 . 5 mg / ml ) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of
Drugs: tamca
Sentence: anaesthetized rats .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia .
Drugs: 
Sentence: findings : fs containing tamca caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours .
Drugs: tamca
Sentence: the degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tamca .
Drugs: tamca
Sentence: thus , fs containing 47 . 5 mg / ml tamca evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats ( n = 6 ) while the lowest concentration of tamca (
Drugs: tamca, tamca
Sentence: 0 . 5 mg / ml ) only evoked brief episodes of jerk - correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in contrast , fs containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity .
Drugs: 
Sentence: interpretation :
Drugs: 
Sentence: tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within fs .
Drugs: tranexamicacid, acid
Sentence: thus , use of fs containing tamca for surgery within or close to the cns may pose a substantial risk to the patient .

Sentence: nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of amphetamine ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) .
Drugs: amphetamine
Sentence: the animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups ( ad libitum 10 % sucrose and chow followed by
Drugs: sucrose, amphetamine, sucrose
Sentence: amphetamine injection , cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection , ad libitum chow with amphetamine , or cyclic 10 % sucrose and chow with a saline injection ) .
Drugs: amphetamine, amphetamine, amphetamine, sucrose
Sentence: these results suggest that a diet comprised of alternating deprivation and access to a sugar solution and chow produces bingeing on sugar that leads to a long lasting state of
Drugs: 
Sentence: increased sensitivity to amphetamine , possibly due to a lasting alteration in the dopamine system .

Drugs: 
Sentence: smooth muscle cells .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the aorta / serum - ratio and the radioactive build - up 24 and 48 hours after injection of 131i - hsa was reduced in animals treated with
Drugs: 
Sentence: d - pen for 42 days , indicating an impeded transmural transport of tracer which may be caused by a steric exclusion effect of abundant hyaluronate .
Drugs: d-pen, pen, hyaluronate
Sentence: the endothelial ultrastructure was unaffected by d - pen , and no differences in aortic 131i - hsa radioactivity or aorta / serum - ratio were recorded between experimental and
Drugs: d-pen, pen
Sentence: control groups 10 minutes after tracer injection , indicating that the permeability of the endothelial barrier to albumin remained unaffected by d - pen treatment .
Drugs: d-pen, pen
Sentence: these observations support the hypothesis that treatment with high doses of d - pen may induce a fibroproliferative response in rat aorta , possibly by an inhibitory effect on the

Drugs: 
Sentence: here we report a case of acute hepatitis probably associated with the administration of telithromycin .
Drugs: telithromycin
Sentence: spironolactone - induced renal insufficiency and hyperkalemia in patients with heart failure .
Drugs: spironolactone
Sentence: background :
Drugs: 
Sentence: a previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of spironolactone in heart failure patients reported a low risk of hyperkalemia ( 2 % ) and renal insufficiency ( 0 %
Drugs: spironolactone
Sentence: ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: because treatments for heart failure have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported , the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice .
Drugs: spironolactone
Sentence: we therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone .
Drugs: spironolactone
Sentence: methods :
Drugs: 
Sentence: we performed a case control study of heart failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practice .
Drugs: spironolactone
Sentence: cases were patients who developed hyperkalemia ( k ( + ) > 5 . 0 meq / l ) or renal insufficiency ( cr > or = 2 . 5
Drugs: k, cr
Sentence: mg / dl ) , and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case .
Drugs: 
Sentence: clinical characteristics , medications , and serum chemistries at baseline and follow - up time periods were compared .
Drugs: 
Sentence: results :
Drugs: 
Sentence: sixty - seven of 926 patients ( 7 . 2 % ) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia ( n = 33 ) or renal failure ( n =
Drugs: spironolactone
Sentence: 34 ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes , had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses , and were more likely
Drugs: potassium, potassium
Sentence: to be treated with beta - blockers than controls ( n = 134 ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: patients who developed renal insufficiency had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum creatinine , required higher doses of loop diuretics , and were more likely to be treated
Drugs: creatinine
Sentence: with thiazide diuretics than controls .
Drugs: thiazide
Sentence: conclusions :
Drugs: 
Sentence: spironolactone - induced hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency are more common in our clinical experience than reported previously .
Drugs: spironolactone
Sentence: this difference is explained by patient comorbidities and more frequent use of beta - blockers .

Sentence: patients were divided into three groups : controls , no crf or esrd , n = 748 ; crf , sustained serum creatinine > 2 . 5 mg / dl
Drugs: creatinine
Sentence: , n = 41 ; and esrd , n = 45 .
Drugs: 
Sentence: groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables , diagnosis , postoperative variables , survival , type of esrd therapy , and survival from onset of esrd .
Drugs: 
Sentence: results :
Drugs: 
Sentence: at 13 years after oltx , the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18 . 1 % ( crf 8 . 6 % and esrd 9 . 5 % )
Drugs: 
Sentence: .
Drugs: 
Sentence: compared with control patients , crf and esrd patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels , a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome , higher percentage requirement for dialysis
Drugs: creatinine
Sentence: in the first 3 months postoperatively , and a higher 1 - year serum creatinine .
Drugs: creatinine
Sentence: multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year , 3 months , and 4 weeks
Drugs: creatinine
Sentence: postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of crf or esrd with odds ratios of 2 . 6 , 2 . 2 , and 1 . 6 , respectively
Drugs: 
Sentence: .
Drugs: 
Sentence: overall survival from the time of oltx was not significantly different among groups , but by year 13 , the survival of the patients who had esrd was only 28
Drugs: 
Sentence: . 2 % compared with 54 . 6 % in the control group .
Drugs: 
Sentence: patients developing esrd had a 6 - year survival after onset of esrd of 27 % for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71 . 4 % for the patients developing
Drugs: 
Sentence: esrd who subsequently received kidney transplants .
Drugs: 
Sentence: conclusions :
Drugs: 
Sentence: patients who are more than 10 years post - oltx have crf and esrd at a high rate .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the development of esrd decreases survival , particularly in those patients treated with dialysis only .
Drugs: 
Sentence: patients who develop esrd have a higher preoperative and 1 - year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome .
Drugs: creatinine
Sentence: however , an increase of serum creatinine at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of crf or esrd .
Drugs: creatinine
Sentence: new strategies for long - term immunosuppression may be needed to decrease this complication .
Drugs: 
Sentence: effect of intravenous nimodipine on blood pressure and outcome after acute stroke .
Drugs: nimodipine
Sentence: background and purpose :
Drugs: 
Sentence: the intravenous nimodipine west european stroke trial ( inwest ) found a correlation between nimodipine - induced reduction in blood pressure ( bp ) and an unfavorable outcome in acute

Sentence: results :
Drugs: 
Sentence: two hundred sixty - five patients were included in this analysis ( n = 92 , 93 , and 80 for placebo , low dose , and high dose ,
Drugs: 
Sentence: respectively ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: nimodipine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in systolic bp ( sbp ) and diastolic bp ( dbp ) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days
Drugs: nimodipine
Sentence: .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in multivariate analysis , a significant correlation between dbp reduction and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high - dose group ( beta = 0 . 49

Sentence: dependency ( barthel index < 60 ) ( n / n = 25 / 26 , or 10 . 16 , 95 % ci 1 . 02 to 101 .
Drugs: 
Sentence: 74 ) and death alone ( n / n = 9 / 26 , or 4 . 336 , 95 % ci 1 . 131 16 . 619 ) compared
Drugs: 
Sentence: with all placebo patients ( n / n = 62 / 92 and 14 / 92 , respectively ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: there was no correlation between sbp change and outcome .
Drugs: 
Sentence: conclusions : dbp , but not sbp ,
Drugs: 
Sentence: reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high - dose nimodipine after acute stroke .
Drugs: nimodipine
Sentence: for low - dose nimodipine , the results were not conclusive .
Drugs: nimodipine
Sentence: these results do not confirm or exclude a neuroprotective property of nimodipine .
Drugs: nimodipine
Sentence: transient neurologic symptoms after spinal anesthesia : a lower incidence with prilocaine and bupivacaine than with lidocaine .
Drugs: prilocaine, bupivacaine, lidocaine
Sentence: background :
Drugs: 
Sentence: recent evidence suggests that transient neurologic symptoms ( tnss ) frequently follow lidocaine spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with bupivacaine .
Drugs: lidocaine, bupivacaine
Sentence: however , identification of a short - acting local anesthetic to substitute for lidocaine for brief surgical procedures remains an important goal .
Drugs: lidocaine
Sentence: prilocaine is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of lidocaine .
Drugs: prilocaine, lidocaine
Sentence: accordingly , the present , prospective double - blind study compares prilocaine with lidocaine and bupivacaine with respect to duration of action and relative risk of tnss .
Drugs: prilocaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine
Sentence: methods :
Drugs: 
Sentence: ninety patients classified as american society of anesthesiologists physical status

Drugs: 
Sentence: results :
Drugs: 
Sentence: nine of 30 patients receiving lidocaine experienced tnss , 1 of 30 patients receiving prilocaine ( p = 0 . 03 ) had them , and none of 30 patients
Drugs: lidocaine, prilocaine
Sentence: receiving bupivacaine had tnss .
Drugs: bupivacaine
Sentence: times to ambulate and to void were similar after lidocaine and prilocaine ( 150 vs . 165 min and 238 vs . 253 min , respectively ) but prolonged after
Drugs: lidocaine, prilocaine
Sentence: bupivacaine ( 200 and 299 min , respectively ; p < 0 . 05 ) .

Drugs: nicotine
Sentence: .
Drugs: 
Sentence: almost certainly , nicotine via its hemodynamic effects contributes to acute cardiovascular events , although current evidence suggests that the effects of nicotine are much less important than are the
Drugs: nicotine, nicotine
Sentence: prothrombotic effects of cigarette smoking or the effects of carbon monoxide .
Drugs: carbonmonoxide, monoxide
Sentence: nicotine does not appear to enhance thrombosis among humans .
Drugs: nicotine
Sentence: clinical studies of pipe smokers and people using transdermal nicotine support the idea that toxins other than nicotine are the most important causes of acute cardiovascular events .
Drugs: nicotine, nicotine
Sentence: finally , the dose response for cardiovascular events of nicotine appears to be flat , suggesting that if nicotine is involved , adverse effects might be seen with relatively low
Drugs: nicotine, nicotine
Sentence: - level cigarette exposures .

Drugs: ursodeoxycholicacid, acid, udca, udca
Sentence: to follow up .
Drugs: 
Sentence: after one year of treatment , five of the remaining nine patients showed either partial ( n = 3 ) or complete ( n = 2 ) gall stone dissolution
Drugs: 
Sentence: , suggesting that their stones were cholesterol rich .
Drugs: cholesterol
Sentence: this corresponds , by actuarial ( life table ) analysis , to a combined gall stone dissolution rate of 58 . 3 ( 15 . 9 % ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in conclusion , octreotide induced gall stones are generally small , multiple , and cholesterol rich although , in common with spontaneous gall stone disease , at presentation some patients

Sentence: hyperkalemia associated with sulindac therapy .
Drugs: sulindac
Sentence: hyperkalemia has recently been recognized as a complication of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents ( nsaid ) such as indomethacin .
Drugs: indomethacin
Sentence: several recent studies have stressed the renal sparing features of sulindac , owing to its lack of interference with renal prostacyclin synthesis .
Drugs: sulindac, prostacyclin
Sentence: we describe 4 patients in whom hyperkalemia ranging from 6 . 1 to 6 . 9 meq / l developed within 3 to 8 days of sulindac administration .
Drugs: sulindac
Sentence: in all of them normal serum potassium levels reached within 2 to 4 days of stopping sulindac .
Drugs: potassium, sulindac
Sentence: as no other medications known to effect serum potassium had been given concomitantly , this course of events is suggestive of a cause - and - effect relationship between
Drugs: potassium
Sentence: sulindac and hyperkalemia .
Drugs: sulindac
Sentence: these observations indicate that initial hopes that sulindac may not be associated with the adverse renal effects of other nsaid are probably not justified .
Drugs: sulindac
Sentence: ventricular tachyarrhythmias during cesarean section after ritodrine therapy : interaction with anesthetics .

Drugs: estrogen, bromocriptine
Sentence: to clarify the effects of bromocriptine on prolactinoma cells in vivo , immunohistochemical , ultrastructural and morphometrical analyses were applied to estrogen - induced rat prolactinoma cells 1 h and
Drugs: bromocriptine, estrogen
Sentence: 6 h after injection of bromocriptine ( 3 mg / kg of body weight ) .
Drugs: bromocriptine
Sentence: one h after treatment , serum prolactin levels decreased markedly .
Drugs: 
Sentence: electron microscopy disclosed many secretory granules , slightly distorted rough endoplasmic reticulum , and partially dilated golgi cisternae in the prolactinoma cells .
Drugs: 
Sentence: morphometric analysis revealed that the volume density of secretory granules increased , while the volume density of cytoplasmic microtubules decreased .
Drugs: 
Sentence: these findings suggest that lowered serum prolactin levels in the early phase of bromocriptine treatment may result from an impaired secretion of prolactin due to decreasing numbers of cytoplasmic microtubules
Drugs: bromocriptine
Sentence: .
Drugs: 
Sentence: at 6 h after injection , serum prolactin levels were still considerably lower than in controls .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the prolactinoma cells at this time were well granulated , with vesiculated rough endoplasmic reticulum and markedly dilated golgi cisternae .
Drugs: 
Sentence: electron microscopical immunohistochemistry revealed positive reaction products noted on the secretory granules , golgi cisternae , and endoplasmic reticulum of the untreated rat prolactinoma cells .
Drugs: 
Sentence: however , only secretory granules showed the positive reaction products for prolactin 6 h after bromocriptine treatment of the adenoma cells .
Drugs: bromocriptine
Sentence: an increase in the volume density of secretory granules and a decrease in the volume densities of rough endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules was determined by morphometric analysis , suggesting that
Drugs: 
Sentence: bromocriptine inhibits protein synthesis as well as bringing about a disturbance of the prolactin secretion .
Drugs: bromocriptine
Sentence: on two paradoxical side - effects of prednisolone in rats , ribosomal rna biosyntheses , and a mechanism of action .
Drugs: prednisolone
Sentence: liver enlargement and muscle wastage occurred in wistar rats following the subcutaneous administration of prednisolone .
Drugs: prednisolone
Sentence: in the liver both the content of rna and the biosynthesis of ribosomal rna increased while both the rna content and ribosomal rna biosynthesis were reduced in the gastrocnemius muscle
Drugs: 
Sentence: .
Drugs: 
Sentence: it is suggested that the drug acted in a selective and tissue - specific manner to enhance ribosomal rna synthesis in the liver and depress such synthesis in the muscle
Drugs: 
Sentence: .
Drugs: 
Sentence: this view supports the contention that the liver and muscle are independent sites of prednisolone action .
Drugs: prednisolone

Drugs: 
Sentence: increasing doses of catecholamines , sedatives , and muscle relaxants administered through a central venous catheter were ineffective .
Drugs: catecholamines
Sentence: however , a bolus of epinephrine injected through an alternative catheter provoked a hypertensive crisis .
Drugs: epinephrine
Sentence: thus , interference with the central venous infusion by the dialysis catheter was suspected .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the catheters were changed , and hemodynamics stabilized at lower catecholamine doses .
Drugs: catecholamine
Sentence: when the effects of iv drugs are inadequate in patients receiving cvvhdf , interference with adjacent catheters resulting in elimination of the drug by cvvhdf should be suspected .
Drugs: 
Sentence: long - term glutamate supplementation failed to protect against peripheral neurotoxicity of paclitaxel .

Drugs: capsaicin
Sentence: perceived pain intensity is modulated by attention .
Drugs: 
Sentence: however , it is not known that how pain intensity ratings are affected by attention in capsaicin - induced secondary hyperalgesia .
Drugs: capsaicin
Sentence: here we show that perceived pain intensity in secondary hyperalgesia is decreased when attention is distracted away from the painful pinprick stimulus with a visual task .

Drugs: 
Sentence: in this study , the hypothesis was tested that there is a sexual dimorphism in hs - induced upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen mediated by testosterone that also causes increases in
Drugs: testosterone
Sentence: bp and renal injury .
Drugs: 
Sentence: on a low - salt ( ls ) diet , male ds had higher levels of intrarenal angiotensinogen mrna than females .
Drugs: salt
Sentence: hs diet for 4 wk increased renal cortical angiotensinogen mrna and protein only in male ds , which was prevented by castration .
Drugs: 
Sentence: ovariectomy of female ds had no effect on intrarenal angiotensinogen expression on either diet .
Drugs: 
Sentence: radiotelemetric bp was similar between males and castrated rats on ls diet .
Drugs: 
Sentence: hs diet for 4 wk caused a progressive increase in bp , protein and albumin excretion , and glomerular sclerosis in male ds rats , which were attenuated by castration
Drugs:

Drugs: 
Sentence: massive urinary protein excretion has been observed after conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) inhibitors , especially sirolimus , in renal transplant recipients with
Drugs: rapamycin, sirolimus
Sentence: chronic allograft nephropathy .
Drugs: 
Sentence: because proteinuria is a major predictive factor of poor transplantation outcome , many studies focused on this adverse event during the past years .
Drugs: 
Sentence: whether proteinuria was due to sirolimus or only a consequence of calcineurin inhibitors withdrawal remained unsolved until high range proteinuria has been observed during sirolimus therapy in islet transplantation and
Drugs: sirolimus, sirolimus
Sentence: in patients who received sirolimus de novo .
Drugs: sirolimus
Sentence: podocyte injury and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis have been related to mtor inhibition in some patients , but the pathways underlying these lesions remain hypothetic .
Drugs: 
Sentence: we discuss herein the possible mechanisms and the significance of mtor blockade - induced proteinuria .
Drugs: 
Sentence: hypothalamic prolactin receptor messenger ribonucleic acid levels , prolactin signaling , and hyperprolactinemic inhibition of pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion are dependent on estradiol .
Drugs: ribonucleicacid, acid, estradiol
Sentence: hyperprolactinemia can reduce fertility and libido .
Drugs: 
Sentence: although central prolactin actions are thought to contribute to this , the mechanisms are poorly understood .
Drugs: 
Sentence: we first tested whether chronic hyperprolactinemia inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility : pulsatile lh secretion and the estrogen - induced lh surge .
Drugs: estrogen
Sentence: chronic hyperprolactinemia induced by the dopamine antagonist sulpiride caused a 40 % reduction lh pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats , but only in the presence of chronic low levels of
Drugs: dopamine, sulpiride
Sentence: estradiol .
Drugs: estradiol
Sentence: sulpiride did not affect the magnitude of a steroid - induced lh surge or the percentage of gnrh neurons activated during the surge .
Drugs: sulpiride, steroid
Sentence: estradiol is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors ( prl - r ) and components of prolactin 's signaling pathway .
Drugs: estradiol
Sentence: to test the hypothesis that estrogen increases prl - r expression and sensitivity to prolactin , we next demonstrated that estradiol greatly augments prolactin - induced stat5 activation .
Drugs: estrogen, estradiol
Sentence: lastly , we measured prl - r and suppressor of cytokine signaling ( socs - 1 and - 3 and cis , which reflect the level of prolactin signaling )
Drugs: 
Sentence: mrnas in response to sulpiride and estradiol .
Drugs: sulpiride, estradiol
Sentence: sulpiride induced only socs - 1 in the medial preoptic area , where gnrh neurons are regulated , but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus , prl - r
Drugs: sulpiride
Sentence: , socs - 3 , and cis mrna levels were also induced .
Drugs: 
Sentence: estradiol enhanced these effects on socs - 3 and cis .
Drugs: estradiol
Sentence: interestingly , estradiol also induced prl - r , socs - 3 , and cis mrna levels independently .
Drugs: estradiol
Sentence: these data show that gnrh pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic hyperprolactinemia in a steroid - dependent manner .
Drugs: steroid
Sentence: they also provide evidence for estradiol - dependent and brain region - specific regulation of prl - r expression and signaling responses by prolactin .
Drugs: estradiol
Sentence: estrogen prevents cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages induced by the hiv protease inhibitor ritonavir .
Drugs: cholesterylester, ester, ritonavir
Sentence: individuals with hiv can now live long lives with drug therapy that often includes protease inhibitors such as ritonavir .
Drugs: ritonavir
Sentence: many patients , however , develop negative long - term side effects such as premature atherosclerosis .
Drugs: 
Sentence: we have previously demonstrated that ritonavir treatment increases atherosclerotic lesion formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mice .
Drugs: ritonavir
Sentence: furthermore , peripheral blood monocytes isolated from ritonavir - treated females had less cholesteryl ester accumulation .
Drugs: ritonavirester, ester
Sentence: in the present study , we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in response to the hiv protease inhibitor ritonavir .
Drugs: cholesterol, ritonavir
Sentence: we have utilized the human monocyte cell line ,
Drugs: 
Sentence: thp - 1 as a model to address this question .

Drugs: 17beta-estradiol, estradiol, e2, progesterone, ethanol
Sentence: cells were then treated with 30 ng / ml ritonavir or vehicle in the presence of aggregated ldl for 24 h . cell extracts were harvested , and lipid or
Drugs: ritonavir
Sentence: total rna was isolated .
Drugs: 
Sentence: e2 decreased the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages following ritonavir treatment .
Drugs: e2esters, esters, ritonavir
Sentence: ritonavir increased the expression of the scavenger receptor , cd36 mrna , responsible for the uptake of ldl .
Drugs: ritonavir
Sentence: additionally , ritonavir treatment selectively increased the relative levels of ppargamma mrna , a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of cd36 mrna expression .
Drugs: ritonavir
Sentence: treatment with e2 , however , failed to prevent these increases at the mrna level .
Drugs: e2
Sentence: e2 did , however , significantly suppress cd36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry .
Drugs: e2
Sentence: this data suggests that e2 modifies the expression of cd36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte - derived macrophages resulting in reduced cholesteryl ester accumulation following ritonavir treatment
Drugs: e2ester, ester, ritonavir

Drugs: 
Sentence: upregulation of brain expression of p - glycoprotein in mrp2 - deficient tr ( - ) rats resembles seizure - induced up - regulation of this drug efflux transporter in
Drugs: 
Sentence: normal rats .
Drugs: 
Sentence: purpose :
Drugs: 
Sentence: the multidrug resistance protein 2 ( mrp2 ) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at
Drugs: 
Sentence: the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood - brain barrier ( bbb ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: mrp2 is absent in the transport - deficient ( tr ( - ) )
Drugs: 
Sentence: wistar rat mutant , so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of mrp2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in mrp2 - deficient
Drugs: 
Sentence: rats with those in transport - competent wistar rats .
Drugs: 
Sentence: by using this strategy to study the involvement of mrp2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs ( aeds ) , we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for mrp2
Drugs: phenytoin
Sentence: in the bbb .
Drugs: 
Sentence: however , one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur .
Drugs: 
Sentence: this prompted us to study the brain expression of p - glycoprotein ( pgp ) , a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues , including the bbb , in
Drugs: 
Sentence: tr ( - ) rats compared with nonmutant ( wild - type ) wistar rats .
Drugs: 
Sentence: methods :
Drugs: 
Sentence: the expression of mrp2 and pgp in brain and liver sections of tr ( - ) rats and normal wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry , by using a novel
Drugs: 
Sentence: , highly selective monoclonal mrp2 antibody and the monoclonal pgp antibody c219 , respectively .
Drugs: 
Sentence: results :
Drugs: 
Sentence: immunofluorescence staining with the mrp2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal wistar rats , whereas such labeling was absent in tr
Drugs: 
Sentence: ( - ) rats .
Drugs: 
Sentence: tr ( - ) rats exhibited a significant up - regulation of pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild - type controls .
Drugs: 
Sentence: no such obvious upregulation of pgp was observed in liver sections .
Drugs: 
Sentence: a comparable overexpression of pgp in the bbb was obtained after pilocarpine - induced seizures in wild - type wistar rats .
Drugs: pilocarpine
Sentence: experiments with systemic administration of the pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective pgp inhibitor tariquidar in tr ( - ) rats substantiated that pgp is functional and compensates for the
Drugs: phenobarbital, tariquidar
Sentence: lack of mrp2 in the bbb .
Drugs: 
Sentence: conclusions :
Drugs: 
Sentence: the data on tr ( - ) rats indicate that pgp plays an important role in the compensation of mrp2 deficiency in the bbb .
Drugs: 
Sentence: because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds , the present data substantiate the concept that mrp2 performs a protective role
Drugs: 
Sentence: in the bbb .
Drugs: 
Sentence: furthermore , our data suggest that tr ( - ) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of pgp in the bbb on access of drugs in
Drugs: 
Sentence: the brain , without the need of inducing seizures or other pgp - enhancing events for this purpose .
Drugs: 
Sentence: use of chromosome substitution strains to identify seizure susceptibility loci in mice .
Drugs: 
Sentence: seizure susceptibility varies among inbred mouse strains .
Drugs: 
Sentence: chromosome substitution strains ( css ) , in which a single chromosome from one inbred strain ( donor ) has been transferred onto a second strain ( host ) by
Drugs: 
Sentence: repeated backcrossing , may be used to identify quantitative trait loci ( qtls ) that contribute to seizure susceptibility .
Drugs: 
Sentence: qtls for susceptibility to pilocarpine - induced seizures , a model of temporal lobe epilepsy , have not been reported , and css have not previously been used to localize
Drugs: pilocarpine
Sentence: seizure susceptibility genes .
Drugs: 
Sentence: we report qtls identified using a b6 ( host ) x
Drugs: 
Sentence: a / j ( donor ) css panel to localize genes involved in susceptibility to pilocarpine - induced seizures .
Drugs: pilocarpine
Sentence: three hundred fifty - five adult male css mice , 58 b6 , and 39 a / j were tested for susceptibility to pilocarpine - induced seizures .
Drugs: pilocarpine
Sentence: highest stage reached and latency to each stage were recorded for all mice .
Drugs: 
Sentence: b6 mice were resistant to seizures and slower to reach stages compared to a / j mice .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the css for chromosomes 10 and 18 progressed to the most severe stages , diverging dramatically from the b6 phenotype .
Drugs: 
Sentence: latencies to stages were also significantly shorter for css10 and css18 mice .
Drugs: 
Sentence: css mapping suggests seizure susceptibility loci on mouse chromosomes 10 and 18 .
Drugs: 
Sentence: this approach provides a framework for identifying potentially novel homologous candidate genes for human temporal lobe epilepsy .
Drugs: 
Sentence: investigation of mitochondrial involvement in the experimental model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine .
Drugs: pilocarpine
Sentence: mitochondrial abnormalities have been associated with several aspects of epileptogenesis , such as energy generation , control of cell death , neurotransmitter synthesis , and free radical ( fr )
Drugs: 
Sentence: production .
Drugs: 
Sentence: increased production of frs may cause mtdna damage leading to decreased activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes containing mtdna - encoded subunits .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in this study , we investigated whether increased generation of fr during status epilepticus would be sufficient to provoke abnormalities in mtdna and in the expression and activity of cytochrome
Drugs: 
Sentence: c oxidase ( cco ) , complex iv of the respiratory chain , in the chronic phase of the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy .
Drugs: pilocarpine
Sentence: dna analysis revealed low amounts of a 4 . 8 kb mtdna deletion but with no differences in frequency or quantity in the control and experimental groups .
Drugs: 
Sentence: we did not find abnormalities in the expression and distribution of an mtdna - encoded subunit of cco ( cco - i ) or a relative decrease in cco -
Drugs: 
Sentence: i when compared with nuclear - encoded subunits ( cco - iv and sdh - fp ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: no abnormality in cco activity was observed through histochemistry .
Drugs: 
Sentence: although evidences of mitochondrial abnormalities were found in previously published studies , our results do not suggest that the frs , generated during the acute phase , determined important abnormalities
Drugs: 
Sentence: in mtdna , in expression of cco - i , and in cco activity .
Drugs:

Drugs: 
Sentence: , saudi arabia , by reviewing the slides of all transplant biopsies ( n = 25 ) performed during this interval .
Drugs: 
Sentence: pre - and posttransplant crossmatching was done when possible .
Drugs: 
Sentence: results :
Drugs: 
Sentence: five cases of thrombotic microangiopathy were found .
Drugs: 
Sentence: three of these cases were from the 25 transplantations performed at king fahad national guard hospital , while the other 2 transplantations had been performed abroad and were referred to
Drugs: 
Sentence: us for follow - up .
Drugs: 
Sentence: three cases were related to cyclosporine , and 1 case was secondary to both cyclosporine and tacrolimus .
Drugs: cyclosporine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus
Sentence: the fifth case had features of thrombotic microangiopathy related to an antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus .
Drugs: 
Sentence: conclusions :
Drugs: 
Sentence: in the literature , the most - frequent cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in patients following renal transplantation is recurrence of the hemolytic uremic syndrome .
Drugs: 
Sentence: other causes include drug - related ( cyclosporine , tacrolimus ) toxicity , procoagulant status , and antibody - mediated rejection .
Drugs: cyclosporine, tacrolimus
Sentence: we found that the most - frequent cause of thrombotic microangiopathy was drug related , secondary mainly to cyclosporine .
Drugs: cyclosporine

Drugs: 
Sentence: 75 % had renal injury , whereas 5 % of group b had increased risk and 2 . 5 % had renal injury .
Drugs: 
Sentence: whereas 33 . 3 % of the patients with cin were among those who received the proper dosage of cm , the percentage increased to 66 . 6 % among
Drugs: cm
Sentence: those who received larger doses , with a significant difference in the incidence of cin related to the different dosages of cm ( p = 0 . 014 ) .
Drugs: cm
Sentence: among the 15 patients with cin , 6 had cyanotic congenital heart diseases , but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the noncyanotic patients ( p =

Sentence: benzoylecgonine and no samples ( 0 % , 95 % ci 0 - 1 . 2 % ) were positive for amphetamine .
Drugs: benzoylecgonine, amphetamine
Sentence: positive test results were more common in patient visits where there was a history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse ( p < 0 . 0005 ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: conclusions :
Drugs: 
Sentence: during this study period , routine plasma screening for cocaine and amphetamines in adult seizure patients had a low yield .
Drugs: cocaine, amphetamines
Sentence: as a result , routine plasma screening would yield few cases of stimulant drug in which there was neither a history nor suspicion of drug abuse in this population .
Drugs: 
Sentence: evidence of functional somatotopy in gpi from results of pallidotomy .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the objective of this study was to explore the functional anatomy of the globus pallidus internus ( gpi ) by studying the effects of unilateral pallidotomy on parkinsonian ' off
Drugs: 
Sentence: ' signs and levodopa - induced dyskinesias ( lid ) .
Drugs: levodopa

Sentence: we also found a highly significant correlation ( p : < 0 . 0001 , r = 0 . 8 ) between the volume of the ventral lesion in the
Drugs: 
Sentence: gpi and the improvement in lid in the contralateral limbs , whereas there was no correlation between the ventral volume and the improvement in parkinsonian ' off ' signs .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the volumes of the total lesion cylinder and the dorsal lesion did not correlate with the outcome of either dyskinesias or parkinsonian ' off ' signs .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the differential predictive value of levodopa responsiveness for the outcome of parkinsonian ' off ' signs and lid and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with dyskinesias and parkinsonian
Drugs: levodopa
Sentence: ' off ' signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of parkinsonian ' off ' signs and dyskinesias .
Drugs: 
Sentence: whereas cells in a wider area of the gpi may be implicated in parkinsonism , the ventral gpi seems to be crucial for the manifestation of lid .
Drugs: 
Sentence: we suggest that our observations are additional proof of the functional somatotopy of the systems within the gpi that mediate parkinsonism and dyskinesias , especially along the dorsoventral trajectory used
Drugs: 
Sentence: in pallidotomy .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the outcome of pallidotomy in which the lesion involves the ventral and dorsal gpi could be the net effect of alteration in the activity of pathways which mediate different symptoms
Drugs: 
Sentence: , and hence could be variable .

Sentence: this study was designed to describe pain tolerance and analgesic response in a sample of opioid addicts stabilized in methadone - maintenance ( mm ) treatment ( n = 60
Drugs: methadone
Sentence: ) in comparison to matched nondependent control subjects ( n = 60 ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: by using a placebo - controlled , two - way factorial design , tolerance to cold - pressor ( cp ) pain was examined , both before and after oral
Drugs: 
Sentence: administration of therapeutic doses of common opioid ( hydromorphone 2 mg ) and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory ( ketorolac 10 mg ) analgesic agents .
Drugs: hydromorphone, ketorolac
Sentence: results showed that mm individuals were significantly less tolerant of cp pain than control subjects , replicating previous work .
Drugs: 
Sentence: analgesic effects were significant neither for medication nor group .
Drugs: 
Sentence: these data indicate that mm opioid abusers represent a pain - intolerant subset of clinical patients .
Drugs: 
Sentence: their complaints of pain should be evaluated seriously and managed aggressively .
Drugs: 
Sentence: urine n - acetyl - beta - d - glucosaminidase - - a marker of tubular damage ?

Drugs: 
Sentence: , eight and thirty three .
Drugs: 
Sentence: results :
Drugs: 
Sentence: following intravenous pan urine volume and urine nag activity increased significantly by day two , but returned to normal by day four .
Drugs: pan
Sentence: after day four all treated animals exhibited a marked rise in urine albumin , total protein excretion and nag activity .
Drugs: 
Sentence: electrophoresis showed a generalised increase in middle and high molecular weight urine proteins from day four onwards .
Drugs: 
Sentence: protein droplets first appeared prominent in tubular cells on day four .
Drugs: 
Sentence: peak urine nag activity and a change in nag isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak proteinuria and the reduction in intracellular protein and nag droplets ( day six onwards
Drugs: 
Sentence: ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: conclusions :
Drugs: 
Sentence: this animal model demonstrates that an increase in lysosomal turnover and hence urine nag activity , occurs when increased protein is presented to the tubular cells .
Drugs: 
Sentence: urine nag activity is thus a measure of altered function in the renal tubules and not simply an indicator of damage .
Drugs: 
Sentence: over expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor during the development of estrogen - induced rat pituitary tumors may mediate estrogen - initiated tumor angiogenesis .

Sentence: the results demonstrated that 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) induces neovascularization , as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure .
Drugs: 17beta-estradiol, estradiol, e2
Sentence: the high tumor angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated vegf / vpf protein expression in the e2 exposed pituitary of ovariectomized ( ovex ) rats .
Drugs: e2
Sentence: vegf / vpf and fviiirag immunohistochemistry and endothelial specific lectin ( uea1 ) binding studies , indicate that the elevation of vegf protein expression initially occurred in both blood vessels
Drugs: 
Sentence: and non - endothelial cells .
Drugs: 
Sentence: after 15 days of e2 exposure , vegf / vpf protein expression , in the non - endothelial cell population , sharply declined and was restricted to the blood vessels
Drugs: e2
Sentence: .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the function of non - endothelial - derived vegf is not clear .
Drugs: 
Sentence: furthermore , immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that vegfr - 2 ( flk - 1 / kdr ) , expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7
Drugs: 
Sentence: days of e2 exposure .
Drugs: e2
Sentence: these findings suggest that over expression of vegf and its receptor ( vegfr - 2 ) may play an important role in the initial step of the regulation of

Sentence: relationships during development of myocardial disease .
Drugs: 
Sentence: we measured the degree of morphologic damage by ultrastructural examination of endomyocardial biopsy and the degree of performance abnormally by right heart catheterization in patients receiving dxr .
Drugs: dxr
Sentence: morphologic damage was variable but was proportional to the total cumulative dxr dose between 100 and 600 mg / m2 .
Drugs: dxr
Sentence: performance abnormalities correlated weakly with dose , exhibited a curvilinear relationship , and had a """" threshold """" for expression .
Drugs: 
Sentence: catheterization abnormalities correlated well with morphologic damage ( r = 0 . 57 to 0 . 78 ) in a subgroup of patients in whom exercise hemodynamics were measured ,
Drugs: 
Sentence: and this relationship also exhibited a curvilinear , threshold configuration .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in dxr - cm myocardial damage is proportional to the degree of cytotoxic insult ( dxr dose ) while myocardial function is preserved until a critical dose or degree of

Sentence: a 73 - year - old woman died of aplastic anemia less than two months after undergoing cataract extraction and beginning topical therapy with chloramphenicol .
Drugs: chloramphenicol
Sentence: the first signs of pancytopenia began within one month of the surgery .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the pattern of the aplastic anemia was associated with an idiosyncratic response to chloramphenicol .
Drugs: chloramphenicol
Sentence: this was the second report of fatal aplastic anemia after topical treatment with chloramphenicol for ocular conditions , although two cases of reversible bone marrow hypoplasia have also been reported
Drugs: chloramphenicol
Sentence: .
Drugs: 
Sentence: any other suspected cases of ocular toxicity associated with topically applied chloramphenicol should be reported to the national registry of drug - induced ocular side effects , oregon health sciences

Drugs: cyclosporine, csa
Sentence: administration of 20 mg / kg / day csa for 4 weeks caused renal functional and structural changes similar to those reported in man .
Drugs: csa
Sentence: the combined administration of csa and various chemotherapeutic drugs with a nephrotoxic potential , such as gentamicin ( at therapeutic doses ) , amphothericin b and ketoconazole , which are
Drugs: csab, b, ketoconazole
Sentence: frequently used in immunosuppressed patients , did not aggravate the csa induced toxicity in the rat model .
Drugs: csa
Sentence: gentamicin at toxic doses , however , increased csa nephrotoxicity .
Drugs: gentamicin, csa
Sentence: thus , the nephrotoxicity induced by csa has a different pathogenetic mechanism .
Drugs: csa
Sentence: receptor mechanisms of nicotine - induced locomotor hyperactivity in chronic nicotine - treated rats .
Drugs: nicotine, nicotine
Sentence: rats were pretreated with saline or nicotine ( 1 . 5 mg / kg per day ) by subcutaneously implanting each animal with an alzet osmotic mini - pump which
Drugs: nicotine
Sentence: continuously released saline or nicotine for 1 , 5 and 14 days .

Sentence: in animals pretreated with nicotine for 14 days , the nicotine - induced locomotor response remained to be potentiated .
Drugs: nicotine, nicotine
Sentence: however , this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [ 3h ] spiperone binding sites , whereas the number of striatal l - [ 3h ]
Drugs: spiperone
Sentence: nicotine binding sites and the striatal da level were normal .
Drugs: nicotine, da
Sentence: these results suggest that chronic nicotine - treated rats develop locomotor hyperactivity in response to nicotine initially due to increases of both the density of nicotinic receptors and da concentration
Drugs: nicotine, nicotine, da
Sentence: , followed by inducing da receptor supersensitivity in the striatum .
Drugs: da
Sentence: hydrocortisone - induced hypertension in humans : pressor responsiveness and sympathetic function .

Sentence: effects of suprofen on the isolated perfused rat kidney .
Drugs: suprofen
Sentence: although suprofen has been associated with the development of acute renal failure in greater than 100 subjects , the mechanism of damage remains unclear .
Drugs: suprofen
Sentence: the direct nephrotoxic effects of a single dose of 15 mg of suprofen were compared in the recirculating isolated rat kidney perfused with cell - free buffer with or without
Drugs: suprofen
Sentence: the addition of 5 mg / dl of uric acid .
Drugs: uricacid, acid
Sentence: there were no significant differences in renal sodium excretion , oxygen consumption , or urinary flow rates in kidneys perfused with suprofen compared with the drug - free control groups
Drugs: sodium, oxygen, suprofen
Sentence: .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in contrast , a significant decline in glomerular filtration rate was found after the introduction of suprofen to the kidney perfused with uric acid ; no changes were found with
Drugs: suprofenacid, acid
Sentence: suprofen in the absence of uric acid .
Drugs: suprofenacid, acid
Sentence: a significant decrease in the baseline excretion rate of uric acid was found in rats given suprofen , compared with drug - free controls .
Drugs: uricacid, acid, suprofen
Sentence: however , the fractional excretion of uric acid was unchanged between the groups over the experimental period .
Drugs: uricacid, acid
Sentence: in summary , suprofen causes acute declines in renal function , most likely by directly altering the intrarenal distribution of uric acid .

Sentence: cocaine - induced brainstem seizures and behavior .
Drugs: cocaine
Sentence: a variety of abnormal sensory / motor behaviors associated with electrical discharges recorded from the bilateral brainstem were induced in adult wky rats by mechanical ( electrode implants ) and
Drugs: 
Sentence: dc electrical current stimulations and by acute and chronic administration of cocaine .
Drugs: cocaine
Sentence: the electrode implant implicated one side or the other of the reticular system of the brainstem but subjects were not incapacitated by the stimulations .
Drugs: 
Sentence: cocaine ( 40 mg / kg ) was injected subcutaneously for an acute experiment and subsequent 20 mg / kg doses twice daily for 3 days in a chronic study
Drugs: cocaine
Sentence: .
Drugs: 
Sentence: cocaine generated more abnormal behaviors in the brainstem perturbation group , especially the electrically perturbated subjects .
Drugs: cocaine
Sentence: the abnormal behaviors were yawning , retrocollis , hyperactivity , hypersensitivity , """" beating drum """" behavior , squealing , head bobbing , circling , sniffing , abnormal posturing ,
Drugs: 
Sentence: and facial twitching .
Drugs: 
Sentence: shifts in the power frequency spectra of the discharge patterns were noted between quiet and pacing behavioral states .
Drugs: 
Sentence: hypersensitivity to various auditory , tactile , and visual stimulation was present and shifts in the brainstem ambient power spectral frequency occurred in response to tactile stimulation .
Drugs: 
Sentence: these findings suggest that the brainstem generates and propagates pathological discharges that can be elicited by mechanical and dc electrical perturbation .
Drugs: 
Sentence: cocaine was found to activate the discharge system and thus induce abnormal behaviors that are generated at the discharge site and at distant sites to which the discharge propagates .
Drugs: cocaine
Sentence: cognitive functions may also be involved since dopaminergic and serotonergic cellular elements at the brainstem level are also implicated .

Sentence: increased sulfation and decreased 7alpha - hydroxylation of deoxycholic acid in ethinyl estradiol - induced cholestasis in rats .
Drugs: deoxycholicacidestradiol, estradiol
Sentence: deoxycholic acid conjugation , transport capacity , and metabolism were compared in control and ethinyl estradiol - treated rats .
Drugs: deoxycholicacidestradiol, estradiol
Sentence: control rats were found to have a lower capacity to transport deoxycholic acid than taurodeoxycholic acid , and both were decreased by ethinyl estradiol treatment .
Drugs: deoxycholicacidacidestradiol, estradiol
Sentence: during [ 24 - 14c ] sodium deoxycholate infusion , [ 14c ] biliary bile acid secretion increased , but bile flow did not change significantly in either control or
Drugs: sodiumdeoxycholateacid, acid
Sentence: ethinyl estradiol - treated rats .
Drugs: ethinylestradiol, estradiol
Sentence: ethinyl estradiol - treated animals excreted significantly less 14c as taurocholic acid than did control animals , consistent with an impairment of 7alpha - hydroxylation of taurodeoxycholic acid .
Drugs: ethinylestradiolacidacid, acid
Sentence: ethinyl estradiol treatment did not impair conjugation of deoxycholic acid , but did result in an increase in sulfation of taurodeoxycholic acid from 1 . 5 % in controls to
Drugs: ethinylestradiolacidacid, acid
Sentence: nearly 4 . 0 % ( p less than 0 . 01 ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rat has a poorer tolerance for deoxycholic acid than do certain other species .
Drugs: deoxycholicacid, acid
Sentence: furthermore , the rat converts deoxycholic acid , a poor choleretic , to taurocholic acid , a good choleretic .
Drugs: deoxycholicacidacid, acid
Sentence: when this conversion is impaired with ethinyl estradiol treatment , sulfation may be an important alternate pathway for excretion of this potentially harmful bile acid .

Drugs: 
Sentence: no significant change in these parameters occurred in the control patients .
Drugs: 
Sentence: no significant change in myocardial oxygen consumption occurred after ouabain administration but this may be related to a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure in the ouabain patients than in
Drugs: oxygen, ouabain, ouabain
Sentence: the control patients .
Drugs: 
Sentence: we conclude that in patients with chronic coronary artery disease who are not in clinical congestive heart failure left ventricular end - diastolic volume falls after ouabain administration even when
Drugs: ouabain
Sentence: it is initially normal .
Drugs: 
Sentence: though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension , and , therefore , of myocardial oxygen consumption , it may not be of sufficient magnitude to
Drugs: oxygen
Sentence: prevent a net increase in myocardial oxygen consumption .
Drugs: oxygen
Sentence: nevertheless , compensatory mechanisms prevent a deterioration of resting myocardial metabolism .

Drugs: rp67,58048,968, 968
Sentence: , suggesting that it was mediated by stimulation of both nk1 and nk2 receptors .
Drugs: 
Sentence: intra - arterially given pge2 produced a distinct increase in bladder pressure before initiating a micturition reflex , indicating that the pg had a direct contractant effect on the detrusor
Drugs: pge2, pg
Sentence: smooth muscle .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the effect of intra - arterial pge2 could not be blocked by intra - arterial rp 67 , 580 or sr 48 , 968 , which opens the possibility that
Drugs: pge267,58048,968, 968
Sentence: the micturition reflex elicited by intra - arterial pge2 was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the pg was given intravesically .
Drugs: pge2, pg
Sentence: the present results thus suggest that intra - arterial pge2 , given near the bladder , may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle
Drugs: pge2
Sentence: of the detrusor .
Drugs: 
Sentence: however , when given intravesically , pge2 may stimulate micturition by releasing tachykinins from nerves in and / or immediately below the urothelium .
Drugs: pge2, tachykinins
Sentence: these tachykinins , in turn , initiate a micturition reflex by stimulating nk1 and nk2 receptors .
Drugs: tachykinins
Sentence: prostanoids may , via release of tachykinins , contribute to both urge and bladder hyperactivity seen in inflammatory conditions of the lower urinary tract .
Drugs: prostanoids, tachykinins

Drugs: 
Sentence: plasma and urinary lipids and lipoproteins during the development of nephrotic syndrome induced in the rat by puromycin aminonucleoside .
Drugs: puromycinaminonucleoside, aminonucleoside
Sentence: this study was undertaken to ascertain whether the alterations of plasma lipoproteins found in nephrotic syndrome induced by puromycin aminonucleoside were due to nephrotic syndrome per se , or ,
Drugs: puromycinaminonucleoside, aminonucleoside
Sentence: at least in part , to the aminonucleoside .
Drugs: aminonucleoside
Sentence: the purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes in plasma and urinary lipoproteins during the administration of puromycin aminonucleoside ( 20 mg / kg for 7 days
Drugs: puromycinaminonucleoside, aminonucleoside

Drugs: 
Sentence: - i tended to increase ( 40 % increase at day 5 ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: at the beginning of nephrotic stage ( day 6 ) the concentration of plasma albumin dropped to a very low level , while that of apolipoprotein a - i increased
Drugs: 
Sentence: abruptly ( 4 - fold increase ) and continued to rise , although less steeply , in the following days .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the plasma concentration of hdl followed the same pattern .
Drugs: 
Sentence: plasma vldl and ldl increased at a later stage ( day 9 ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: plasma apolipoprotein a - i was found not only in hdl ( 1 . 063 - 1 . 210 g / ml ) but also in the ldl density class
Drugs: 
Sentence: ( 1 . 025 - 1 . 050 g / ml ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in the pre - nephrotic stage lipoproteinuria was negligible , while in the early nephrotic stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of hdl .
Drugs: 
Sentence: these observations indicate that puromycin aminonucleoside alters plasma lipoproteins by lowering vldl and increasing hdl .
Drugs: puromycinaminonucleoside, aminonucleoside
Sentence: it is likely that the early and striking increase of plasma hdl found in nephrotic rats is related to a direct effect of the drug on hdl metabolism .
Drugs: 
Sentence: circulating lysosomal enzymes and acute hepatic necrosis .

Sentence: the activities of the lysosomal enzymes acid and neutral protease , n - acetylglucosaminidase , and acid phosphatase were measured in the serum of patients with fulminant hepatic failure .
Drugs: 
Sentence: acid protease ( cathepsin d ) activity was increased about tenfold in patients who died and nearly fourfold in those who survived fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose , whereas
Drugs: paracetamol
Sentence: activities were increased equally in patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to viral hepatitis whether or not they survived .
Drugs: 
Sentence: a correlation was found between serum acid protease activity and prothrombin time , and the increase in cathepsin d activity was sustained over several days compared with aspartate aminotransferase ,
Drugs: aspartate

Drugs: 
Sentence: we found that the above - mentioned patient and one of the diabetic kindreds with no history of wernicke 's encephalopathy had abnormal transketolase as determined by its km for
Drugs: 
Sentence: tpp .
Drugs: tpp
Sentence: these data suggest a similarity between postalcoholic wernicke - korsakoff syndrome and the patient with tolazamide - induced wernicke 's encephalopathy from the standpoint of transketolase abnormality .

Sentence: mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine : comparison with exercise - induced ischemia .
Drugs: epinephrine
Sentence: the role of epinephrine in eliciting myocardial ischemia was examined in patients with coronary artery disease .
Drugs: epinephrine
Sentence: objective signs of ischemia and factors increasing myocardial oxygen consumption were compared during epinephrine infusion and supine bicycle exercise .
Drugs: oxygen, epinephrine
Sentence: both epinephrine and exercise produced myocardial ischemia as evidenced by st segment depression and angina .

Sentence: however , the mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine were significantly different from those of exercise .
Drugs: epinephrine
Sentence: exercise - induced myocardial ischemia was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate - pressure product with a minor contribution of end - diastolic volume , while epinephrine -
Drugs: epinephrine
Sentence: induced ischemia was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate - pressure product .
Drugs: 
Sentence: these findings indicate that ischemia produced by epinephrine , as may occur during states of emotional distress , has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion .
Drugs: epinephrine
Sentence: transient contralateral rotation following unilateral substantia nigra lesion reflects susceptibility of the nigrostriatal system to exhaustion by amphetamine .
Drugs: amphetamine
Sentence: following unilateral 6 - ohda induced sn lesion , a transient period of contralateral rotation has been reported to precede the predominant ipsilateral circling .
Drugs: 6-ohda, ohda
Sentence: in order to clarify the nature of this initial contralateral rotation we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion , on amphetamine - induced rotational
Drugs: amphetamine
Sentence: behavior .
Drugs: 
Sentence: three days post lesion , most rats circled predominantly contralaterally to the lesion .
Drugs: 
Sentence: such contralateral rotation may result from either degeneration - induced breakdown of the da pool , or lesion - induced increase of da turnover in the spared neurons .
Drugs: 
Sentence: a substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when amphetamine was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning , indicating involvement of spared cells in the contralateral
Drugs: amphetamine
Sentence: rotation .
Drugs: 
Sentence: however , regardless of the duration of recovery ( and irrespective of either lesion volume , amphetamine dose , or post - lesion motor exercise ) , amphetamine - induced
Drugs: amphetamine, amphetamine
Sentence: rotation tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed , and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further amphetamine injections .
Drugs: amphetamine
Sentence: these findings suggest that amphetamine has an irreversible effect on the post - lesion da pool contributing to contralateral rotation .
Drugs: amphetamine
Sentence: thyroid function and urine - concentrating ability during lithium treatment .
Drugs: lithium
Sentence: it has been suggested that adenylate cyclase inhibition may be important in the development of both nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and hypothyroidism during lithium treatment .
Drugs: lithium
Sentence: we measured serum thyroxine and urine - concentrating ability ( umax ) in response to desmopressin ( ddavp ) in 85 patients receiving lithium .
Drugs: thyroxine, lithium
Sentence: hypothyroidism developed in eight patients while they were taking lithium .
Drugs: lithium
Sentence: impaired umax was found in both euthyroid and hypothyroid patients while some hypothyroid patients concentrated their urine well .
Drugs: 
Sentence: it is concluded that the dominant mechanisms by which lithium exerts these two effects are different .
Drugs: lithium

Sentence: the anaemia induced by 3' - azido - 3'dideoxythymidine ( azt ) is poorly understood .
Drugs: 3'-azido-3'dideoxythymidine, 3'dideoxythymidine, azt
Sentence: we have used a murine model of aids , infection of female c57bl / 6 mice with lp - bm5 murine leukaemia ( mulv ) virus , to determine if
Drugs: 
Sentence: azt - induced anaemia is due , in part , to decreased responsiveness of erythropoietic precursors ( bfu - e ) to erythropoietin ( epo ) .
Drugs: azt
Sentence: mice in the early stage of lp - bm5 mulv disease were given azt in their drinking water at 1 . 0 and 2 . 5 mg / ml .
Drugs: azt
Sentence: azt produced anaemia in both groups , in a dose - dependent fashion .
Drugs: azt
Sentence: despite the anaemia , the number of splenic and bone marrow bfu - e in azt treated mice increased up to five - fold over levels observed in infected untreated
Drugs: azt
Sentence: animals after 15 d of treatment .
Drugs: 
Sentence: colony formation by splenic and bone marrow bfue was stimulated at lower concentrations of epo in mice receiving azt for 15 d than for infected , untreated mice .
Drugs: azt
Sentence: by day 30 , sensitivity of both splenic and bone marrow bfu - e of treated animals returned to that observed from cells of infected untreated animals .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the mean plasma levels of epo observed in azt treated mice were appropriate for the degree of anaemia observed when compared with phenylhydrazine ( phz ) treated mice .
Drugs: azt, phenylhydrazine, phz
Sentence: the numbers of bfu - e and the percentage of bone marrow erythroblasts observed were comparable in azt and phz treated mice with similar degrees of anaemia .
Drugs: azt, phz
Sentence: however , reticulocytosis was inappropriate for the degree of anaemia observed in azt treated infected mice .
Drugs: azt
Sentence: azt - induced peripheral anaemia in the face of increased numbers of bfu - e and increased levels of plasma epo suggest a lesion in terminal differentiation .
Drugs: azt

Drugs: 
Sentence: left ventricular wall ( about 66 % of the control : p less than 0 . 05 ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in the 5 - wk group , mibg accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 35 % and 27 % of that in controls , respectively ( p
Drugs: mibg
Sentence: less than 0 . 001 ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in the 8 - wk group , mibg accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 18 % and 14 % of that in controls , respectively ( p
Drugs: mibg
Sentence: less than 0 . 001 ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: thus , mibg accumulation in the myocardium decreased in an adriamycin dose - dependent manner .
Drugs: mibg, adriamycin
Sentence: the appearance of impaired cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in the presence of slight myocardial impairment ( scattered or focal vacuolar degeneration ) indicates that mibg scintigraphy may be a useful

Drugs: 
Sentence: biphasic response of the sa node of the dog heart in vivo to selective administration of ketamine .
Drugs: ketamine
Sentence: effect of ketamine on the sa node of the dog heart was studied in vivo using a selective perfusion technique of the sa node artery .
Drugs: ketamine
Sentence: injections of ketamine in doses from 100 microgram to 3 mg into the artery produced a depression of the sa nodal activity by a direct action .
Drugs: ketamine
Sentence: this depression was followed by the sudden appearance of a stimulatory phase .
Drugs: 
Sentence: bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the ketamine - induced tachycardia , while it was completely abolished in the
Drugs: ketamine
Sentence: reserpinized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta - blocking agent into the sa node artery .
Drugs: 
Sentence: this may indicate that an activation of the peripheral adrenergic mechanism plays an important role in the induction of the excitatory effect of ketamine injected in the sa node artery
Drugs: ketamine

Sentence: fifteen patients demonstrating unexpected prolonged apnoea lasting several hours after succinylcholine have been treated by a new preparation of human serum cholinesterase .
Drugs: succinylcholine
Sentence: adequate spontaneous respiration was re - established in an average period of ten minutes after the injection .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in 12 patients biochemical genetic examinations confirmed the presence of an atypical serum cholinesterase .
Drugs: 
Sentence: in three patients none of the usual variants were found .
Drugs: 
Sentence: it is therefore supposed that other unknown variants of serum cholinesterase exist which can not hydrolyze succinylcholine .
Drugs: succinylcholine
Sentence: the use of serum cholinesterase in succinylcholine apnoea provided considerable relief to both patient and anaesthetist .

Sentence: effects of verapamil on atrial fibrillation and its electrophysiological determinants in dogs .
Drugs: verapamil
Sentence: background :
Drugs: 
Sentence: atrial tachycardia - induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of atrial fibrillation ( af ) and decreases l - type ca ( 2 + ) current .
Drugs: ca
Sentence: there is also a clinical suggestion that acute l - type ca ( 2 ) channel blockade can promote af , consistent with an af promoting effect of ca (
Drugs: ca, ca
Sentence: 2 + ) channel inhibition .
Drugs: 
Sentence: methods :
Drugs: 
Sentence: to evaluate the potential mechanisms of af promotion by ca ( 2 + ) channel blockers , we administered verapamil to morphine - chloralose anesthetized dogs .

Drugs: 
Sentence: , p < 0 . 005 ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: diltiazem did not affect erp , af cycle length or af duration , but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by verapamil ( n = 5 ) .
Drugs: diltiazem, verapamil
Sentence: in the presence of autonomic blockade , verapamil failed to promote af and increased , rather than decreasing , refractoriness .
Drugs: verapamil
Sentence: neither verapamil nor diltiazem affected atrial conduction in the presence of autonomic blockade .
Drugs: verapamil, diltiazem
Sentence: epicardial mapping suggested that verapamil promoted af by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle .
Drugs: verapamil
Sentence: conclusions :
Drugs: 
Sentence: verapamil promotes af in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry , an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by diltiazem .

Drugs: 
Sentence: experimental cranial pain elicited by capsaicin : a pet study .
Drugs: capsaicin
Sentence: using a positron emission tomography ( pet ) study it was shown recently that in migraine without aura certain areas in the brain stem were activated during the headache state
Drugs: 
Sentence: , but not in the headache free interval .
Drugs: 
Sentence: it was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the migraine attack itself and represents the so called ' migraine generator ' .
Drugs: 
Sentence: to test this hypothesis we performed an experimental pain study in seven healthy volunteers , using the same positioning in the pet scanner as in the migraine patients .
Drugs: 
Sentence: a small amount of capsaicin was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve .

Sentence: risperidone , a benzisoxazole derivative antipsychotic , has high serotonin 5 - ht2 receptor blockade and dose - related d2 receptor blockade .
Drugs: risperidone, benzisoxazole, serotonin
Sentence: the high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone at low dosages .
Drugs: risperidone
Sentence: with this low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms , it was thought the frequency of neuroleptic malignant syndrome might also be lowered .
Drugs: 
Sentence: a 73 - year - old woman developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome after monotherapy with risperidone .
Drugs: risperidone
Sentence: the syndrome reversed after discontinuing risperidone and starting treatment with dantrolene and bromocriptine .
Drugs: risperidone, dantrolene, bromocriptine
Sentence: it appears that the protection from extrapyramidal side effects observed with risperidone does not ensure protection from neuroleptic malignant syndrome .

Sentence: borderline hypertensive men ( n = 24 ) were selected with screening systolic blood pressure ( bp ) of 140 to 160 mm hg and / or diastolic bp 90
Drugs: 
Sentence: to 99 mm hg .
Drugs: 
Sentence: low - risk controls ( n = 24 ) reported no parental history of hypertension and had screening bp < 130 / 85 mm hg .
Drugs: 
Sentence: participants were then tested on 2 occasions after 12 - hour abstinence from caffeine in each of 2 protocols ; this required a total of 4 laboratory visits .
Drugs: caffeine
Sentence: caffeine - induced changes in diastolic bp were 2 to 3 times larger in borderline subjects than in controls ( + 8 . 4 vs + 3 . 8 mm
Drugs: caffeine
Sentence: hg , p < 0 . 0001 ) , and were attributable to larger changes in impedance - derived measures of systemic vascular resistance ( + 135 vs + 45
Drugs: 
Sentence: dynes . s . cm - 5 , p < 0 . 004 ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: these findings were consistent and reached significance in both protocols .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the percentage of borderline subjects in whom diastolic bp changes exceeded the median control response was 96 % .
Drugs: 
Sentence: consequently , whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline , 33 % of borderline subjects achieved hypertensive bp levels after caffeine ingestion .
Drugs: caffeine
Sentence: thus , in borderline hypertensive men , exaggerated responses to caffeine were : selective for diastolic bp , consistent with greater vasoconstriction , replicated in 2 protocols , and representative
Drugs: caffeine
Sentence: of nearly all borderline hypertensives .
Drugs: 
Sentence: we suspect that the potential for caffeine to stabilize high resistance states in susceptible persons suggests that its use may facilitate their disease progression , as well as hinder accurate

Sentence: apomorphine rescue injections can reliably revert off - periods even in patients with complex on - off motor swings .
Drugs: apomorphine
Sentence: continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions can reduce daily off - time by more than 50 % in this group of patients , which appears to be a stronger effect than that
Drugs: apomorphine
Sentence: generally seen with add - on therapy with oral dopamine agonists or comt inhibitors .
Drugs: dopamine
Sentence: extended follow - up studies of up to 8 years have demonstrated long - term persistence of apomorphine efficacy .
Drugs: apomorphine
Sentence: in addition , there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting levodopa - induced dyskinesias .
Drugs: apomorphine, levodopa
Sentence: the main side effects of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems , whereas sedation and psychiatric complications play a lesser role .
Drugs: apomorphine

Sentence: the hemodynamics of oxytocin and other vasoactive agents during neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery : findings in six cases .
Drugs: oxytocin
Sentence: oxytocin is a commonly used uterotonic that can cause significant and even fatal hypotension , particularly when given as a bolus .
Drugs: oxytocin
Sentence: the resulting hypotension can be produced by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output through a decrease in venous return .
Drugs: 
Sentence: parturients with normal volume status , heart valves and pulmonary vasculature most often respond to this hypotension with a compensatory increase in heart rate and stroke volume .
Drugs: 
Sentence: oxytocin - induced hypotension at cesarean delivery may be incorrectly attributed to blood loss .
Drugs: oxytocin

Drugs: 
Sentence: exaggerated expression of inflammatory mediators in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide knockout ( vip - / - ) mice with cyclophosphamide ( cyp ) - induced cystitis .
Drugs: cyclophosphamide, cyp
Sentence: vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( vip ) is an immunomodulatory neuropeptide distributed in micturition pathways .
Drugs: 
Sentence: vip ( - / - ) mice exhibit altered bladder function and neurochemical properties in micturition pathways after cyclophosphamide ( cyp ) - induced cystitis .
Drugs: cyclophosphamide, cyp
Sentence: given vip 's role as an anti - inflammatory mediator , we hypothesized that vip ( - / - ) mice would exhibit enhanced inflammatory mediator expression after cystitis .
Drugs: 
Sentence: a mouse inflammatory cytokine and receptor rt2 profiler array was used to determine regulated transcripts in the urinary bladder of wild type ( wt ) and vip ( - /
Drugs: 
Sentence: - ) mice with or without cyp - induced cystitis ( 150 mg / kg ; i . p .

Drugs: cyp
Sentence: observed in wt urinary bladder ( 3 . 6 - to 5 - fold increase ) .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the data suggest that in vip ( - / - ) mice with bladder inflammation , inflammatory mediators are increased above that observed in wt with cyp .
Drugs: cyp
Sentence: this shift in balance may contribute to increased bladder dysfunction in vip ( - / - ) mice with bladder inflammation and altered neurochemical expression in micturition pathways .

Drugs: 
Sentence: intraocular pressure - lowering surgeries were considered a success ( postoperative iop of 6 - 21 mm hg with or without additional iop - lowering medication ) in 85 .
Drugs: 
Sentence: 1 % of eyes at 1 year .
Drugs: 
Sentence: the rate of hypotony ( iop < / = 5 mm hg ) following iop - lowering surgery ( 42 . 5 % ) was not different from that of
Drugs: 
Sentence: implanted eyes not subjected to surgery ( 35 . 4 % ) ( p = . 09 ) .

Drugs: 
Sentence: , bradykinesia , and on - off fluctuations .
Drugs: 
Sentence: pallidal stimulation improves bradykinesia and rigidity to a minor extent ; however , its strength seems to be in improving levodopa - induced dyskinesias .
Drugs: levodopa
Sentence: stimulation often produces an improvement in the hyper - or dyskinetic upper limbs , but increases the """" freezing """" phenomenon in the lower limbs at the same time .
Drugs: 
Sentence: considering the small increase in the patient 's independence , the high costs of bilateral implants , and the difficulty most patients experience in handling the devices , the question
Drugs: 
Sentence: arises as to whether bilateral pallidal stimulation is a real alternative to pallidotomy .

Sentence: 1 - / - ones .
Drugs: 
Sentence: similar experiments were conducted in balb / c mice treated with pj34 or vehicle .
Drugs: pj34
Sentence: treatment with a pj34 significantly improved cardiac dysfunction and increased the survival of the animals .
Drugs: pj34
Sentence: in addition pj34 significantly reduced the dox - induced increase in the serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities but not metalloproteinase activation in the heart .
Drugs: pj34, dox, lactate, creatine
Sentence: thus , parp activation contributes to the cardiotoxicity of dox .
Drugs: dox
Sentence: parp inhibitors may exert protective effects against the development of severe cardiac complications associated with the dox treatment .
Drugs: dox

Drugs: fluconazole
Sentence: cessation discussion
Drugs: 
Sentence: : use of the naranjo probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the use of fluconazole and the development of tdp .
Drugs: fluconazole
Sentence: the possible mechanism is depression of rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium currents .
Drugs: potassium
Sentence: in our patient , there was no other etiology identified that could explain qt prolongation or tdp
Drugs: 
Sentence: the complete disappearance of nsvt and premature ventricular contractions followed by normalization of qt interval after the drug was stopped strongly suggests fluconazole as the etiology .
Drugs: fluconazole
Sentence: conclusions :
Drugs: 
Sentence: clinicians should be aware that fluconazole , even at low doses , may cause prolongation of the qt interval , leading to tdp .
Drugs: fluconazole
Sentence: serial electrocardiographic monitoring may be considered when fluconazole is administered in patients who are at risk for ventricular arrhythmias .
